In this tutorial, you'll set up a simple TDTlite project culminating in a .tsv database of instances of "some" with additional information about each instance -- e.g., the match's unique TGrep2 ID, the full sentence, whether "some" occurs in the partitive, and whether "some" occurs at the start of a sentence. To do this easily, use [TDTlite]().

## Set up the project structure

## Add a MACROS file

## Create pattern files

## Search the corpus and build your database
