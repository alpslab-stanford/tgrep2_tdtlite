53:49	and , um , she had used the walker \[ for , \+ for \] quite some time , probably about six to nine months . E_S
363:46	That 's just a matter of * defining priorities , I guess or some priorities anyway . E_S
456:26	Um , but still , it gives it some variety .
868:124	I think 0 in a good example on the typical thing that *T*-1 happens , uh , when the phone rang *T*-2 E_S and it 's T I 0 *T*-3 calling , E_S my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message E_S
905:42	and \[ you , \+ one 's \] feeling obligated , because of some sense \[ of , \+ of \] the way 0 the ritual is played *-1 out *T*-2 . E_S
1125:24	Because anyone can be alone for some period of time E_S
1151:16	or they 're introducing some new product in the area E_S
1179:18	I 've even had some of them , E_S
1208:11	and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I do n't even understand *T*-1 . E_S
1216:20	I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door , either religious groups , or people peddling products . E_S
1284:25	I wonder if there would be some way 0 we could get these people to do this get their names , their addresses , and their phone numbers E_S and then reverse it , E_S and do *T*-1 , N_S
1639:25	I think 0 there is still some discrimination there where \[ as , \+ \] you know , men and women work in the same job *T*-1 , E_S
1686:33	and , uh , quite honestly , I , I have some little children E_S
1842:23	I mean I 've heard some songs \[ that , \+ that \] I just thought 0 *T*-1 were horrendous cover versions of , N_S
1939:11	I saw some promise , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] a lot of the new wave , \[ when it , \+ when it \] came out , uh , back in the mid and early eighties *T*-1 . E_S
1988:13	there are some , you know , types of heavy metal that I really like *T*-1 , E_S
2099:39	Um , \[ it takes some , \+ it *EXP*-1 takes some \] dedication * to do it , E_S
2179:40	so \[ we have , \+ both of us have \] some money in an I R A that we 're also trying *-1 to figure *T*-2 , N_S
2198:136	and they did an analysis *ICH*-4 for us based on what we were putting *T*-1 in and the time frame that we wanted *-2 to look at *T*-3 , and then gave us \[ a good idea back , \+ you know , some good information *ICH*-6 back \] on whether or not we were going *-5 to achieve those goals , \[ and , \+ or \] not , and what we needed *-7 to do *T*-8 so that we could achieve them and the money 0 we could put *T*-9 in at what time . E_S
2333:28	well , uh , maybe I am into some things *ICH*-1 occasionally that I do n't think of *T*-2 in terms of self improvement . E_S
2343:22	I , uh , have attended some seminars that *T*-1 had some tapes that *T*-2 went with them , but , uh , I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things , E_S
2343:40	I , uh , have attended some seminars that *T*-1 had some tapes that *T*-2 went with them , but , uh , I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things , E_S
2398:28	you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other E_S
2451:47	and where we are *T*-1 now , what we 're doing *T*-2 is some very big lawsuits that *T*-3 happen *-4 to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents . E_S
2579:18	Well I 've seen some people try *-2 to just come in like over the weekend because they want *-1 to use the TexTeller machine . E_S
2719:8	And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes E_S
2764:15	I 've done some of the other speech programs , E_S
3025:20	I 've known Jack for some time . E_S
3204:49	\[ So , \+ so \] then \[ we got , \+ we got \] some same things E_S because , N_S
3221:19	like , * give me some examples . E_S
3292:35	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] what some people call like *T*-1 really heavy metal . E_S
3367:17	They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that . E_S
3792:44	and , uh , \[ there 's , \+ uh , there 's \] some petting , you know , like , uh , uh , N_S
3872:17	Well I 've gotten some good ideas from you . E_S
4002:22	he did , well , in some of the later movies
4453:25	So , there must be something to some of them . E_S
4485:45	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] it 's had that orientation for quite some time . E_S
4486:20	Um , there 's been some progressive medical schools *EXP*-1 out here , that *T*-2 have taken that approach . E_S
4524:8	and some of them fizzled out E_S
4525:8	and some of them were disastrous E_S
4587:51	But \[ they , \+ you know , they \] live to a hundred and ten some , you know , E_S
4790:26	You know , I mean , some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions . E_S
4831:20	At least they might get some benefit in that , E_S
4832:49	and if the people 0 they committed a crime against *T*-1 , feel , at some later date , that these people have learned their lesson , \[ are , \+ are \] okay , you know , well , they can free them . E_S
4996:24	they made a position for them some where . E_S
5134:16	And that does take some time . E_S
5150:28	I 've been trying *-1 to do some bibs for him . And , uh , work on his Christmas stocking . E_S
5359:35	Uh , we had \[ some , \+ uh , some \] people from our church 0 *T*-1 went to Israel , uh , just for a , uh , tour sort of thing . E_S
5473:21	But , uh , I know some people at T I , E_S
6390:55	Well , you know , \[ T I , \+ you know , T I \] offers some good stuff E_S
6391:63	and then \[ I think 0 there 's , \+ I mean I think 0 there 's \] some negatives , E_S
6392:26	but there 's going *-1 to be some negatives anywhere , you know , no matter where you go *T*-2 . E_S
6409:32	Uh , I can see \[ some , \+ some \] potential changes that *T*-1 probably \[ \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ would \] not cost very much but might , uh , make things a little easier . Such as * offering \[ a , \+ a \] smorgasbord . Having a larger variety of benefits E_S
6575:44	but I guess , 0 \[ they , \+ you \] could put some money *ICH*-1 aside while you were there , your expenses and , N_S
6585:161	But it *EXP*-1 might be interesting * to see what *T*-2 would happen if you took kids \[ at a , \+ \] and then took then to another country instead of * having being exposed *-5 to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here , and take them to some other country that *T*-3 had different moral values , like Saudi Arabia where they could n't drink *T*-4 . E_S
6601:31	because from what I understand *T*-1 , from some of the guys 0 I know *T*-2 , you know , crime , uh , is punishable , just almost , uh , instantly and public , E_S
6619:201	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess , 0 in my own , * having had the whole three or four minutes 0 * to , you know , give it a great deal of thought *T*-1 , you know , Um , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary , E_S
6680:29	It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have *T*-1 here and develop some pride in them , if it was handled *-2 that way . E_S
6680:62	It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have *T*-1 here and develop some pride in them , if it was handled *-2 that way . E_S
6707:54	and the only opposition to it really was that it was , you know , starting some sort of a military elitist type , you know , special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing . E_S
6714:25	really there could be , um , some scandals involved * , if , you know , it was n't people that *T*-1 were really fair and \[ le- , \+ you know , in a legal \] way or something , E_S
6773:12	She started some type of , um , national organization for youth to volunteer *-2 to \[ teach , \+ tutor \] other kids to read and , you know , do different service projects like that and trying * to get youth more directed towards , you know , helpful things , E_S
6809:100	and they have situations \[ like , \+ like \] that down there . Where \[ they , \+ they \] have , \[ these , \+ the \] social , in some sort of way *T*-1 , N_S
6883:21	and the church helps them out some , E_S
7012:36	Well \[ the , \+ the \] other thing 0 some people are not aware of *T*-1 , is 0 they will use \[ their A , \+ their \] credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash E_S
7087:14	And , then , some people they get so wrapped up in them that \[ they find , \+ you know , one day they find , \] wow , I did n't realize 0 \[ I had this much , \+ you know , I 'd spent this much \] money . E_S
7096:12	Well , and some people use one credit card *-1 to pay for another credit card 0 they own *T*-2 , E_S
7260:11	we did some remodeling when we bought a house *T*-1 , E_S
7262:13	and painting and some wallpapering , E_S
7277:19	* kind of gives you some space for yourself , E_S
7280:12	I made some afghans and that kind of stuff . E_S
7356:11	they have some nice stuff down there . E_S
7520:64	the elections where they have that topic *T*-2 seem *-1 to be a little bit better *ICH*-3 attended than some of the other ones . E_S
7531:35	I can understand \[ why , \+ why \] some of \[ the , \+ the \] rural areas , the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for \[ the , \+ the \] Midwest *T*-1 , E_S
7580:15	MUMBLEx * hope some of the local , N_S
7752:16	But , there are some others out there that I do n't believe 0 *T*-1 deserve the money 0 they 're getting *T*-2 . E_S
8649:25	You want *-1 to get into some kind of manufacturing , E_S
8680:13	so she brings some money in . E_S
8709:103	we 've got \[ a , \+ several \] credit cards that sometimes , um , instead of *-1 paying *T*-2 them all off every month maybe you have *-1 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time . E_S
8761:7	and some you do n't care about *T*-1 , you know , E_S
8858:48	But one of the things that I do *T*-1 when I 've got some spare time *T*-2 is I do some woodworking . E_S
8858:68	But one of the things that I do *T*-1 when I 've got some spare time *T*-2 is I do some woodworking . E_S
8859:66	And that , oh , I guess , ranges anywhere from , uh , carpentry work to , um , um , some types of furniture and , um , oh , I do n't know what you would call them *T*-1 , knickknacks , I guess , stuff 0 you hang *T*-2 on the wall *-3 to put a mirror on *T*-2 E_S
8860:14	and I made some , um , candle sconces that you hang *T*-1 on the ... N_S
8877:24	so I guess 0 I get some of both . E_S
8878:16	What *T*-1 are some of your things 0 you like *-2 to do *T*-3 ? E_S
8923:20	So , those things they take some time 0 * to make *T*-1 . E_S
8950:32	first thing that *T*-1 comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across , you know , back and forth until she winds up with this big piece \[ of , \+ of \] afghan . E_S
8960:41	If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected *-1 some time or other , * do n't worry about it . E_S
9098:86	\[ Do you , \+ uh , do you \] think that those are bigger contributors than things like \[ ai- , \+ acid \] rain and some of the pollutants that *T*-1 come from , uh , industrial areas , factories and so on ? E_S
9188:50	but I do think that , um , Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards . E_S
9212:45	And in the case of air pollution , it simply might turn out at some point down the road , *-1 to be so costly *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems , and everything else that we 'll spend the money that *T*-6 's necessary * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get rid *-2 of the source of it . E_S
9271:30	Uh , once in a while we 'll get some , uh , E_S
9445:74	well , I mean , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 I 've been in some places , you know , where the weather was just so mild *T*-1 , you know , places like Monterey , California or , you know , N_S
9469:5	some people say , uh , 0 \[ they , \+ they \] like *-1 to watch the changing of the seasons E_S
9478:65	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 \[ \[ in , \+ in some , \] \+ in some \] respects it probably MUMBLEx more tolerable . E_S
9481:77	well I guess 0 \[ this , \+ the \] weather is n't as lively a topic \[ as , \+ uh , as \] some of the others 0 we might have gotten *T*-1 . E_S
9493:44	Well I mean I 've had some pretty bad , I guess some pretty controversial topics E_S
9535:20	And then I 've seen some of the STAR TREK movies . E_S
9546:74	\[ When I , \+ when I \] started *-1 thinking about this *T*-2 , \[ that \+ \] those are some of my favorite shows ,
9570:22	He took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder . E_S
9590:74	But , unfortunately I find 0 * getting rid *-1 of your T V set , you do throw out \[ some , \+ some \] of the baby , with the bath water . E_S
9724:26	even in for kids * watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff . E_S
9759:34	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] seen some of them on repeats . E_S
9928:60	They do n't understand that * to make that work , E_S they 've got *-1 to take some responsibility for themselves . E_S
9931:55	when they give you the freedom * to take care of yourself *T*-1 then that puts some responsibility on you as well . E_S
10082:48	I like *-1 to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times *T*-2 . E_S
10195:40	unfortunately the Rangers do n't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do *?* . E_S
10799:76	but , uh , uh , \[ it , \+ it \] did show \[ \[ some , \+ some , \] \+ uh , some \] interesting things about the F B I E_S
10853:46	Well \[ as , it , \+ as I recall it \] got some Academy Awards , did n't it . E_S
11040:16	but they 're predicting some more snow for our direction . E_S
11176:19	but it does defray it some . E_S
11190:55	you know that was one thing 0 we noticed *T*-1 last week that we had some new people move into our building E_S and , you know , the nice cardboard boxes that you move , packing boxes . And they were just used *-1 one time and thrown *-1 in the dumpster E_S
11285:17	but I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids , E_S
11310:14	You saved me some money . E_S
11354:29	and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category , E_S
11524:19	in fact , it got some pretty serious deep parts in it E_S
11618:36	Um , I had a friend who *T*-1 had fixed some , uh , \[ chili , \+ buffalo chili \] \[ and , \+ \] about a week before * went *-2 to see the movie . E_S
11723:23	And I hope 0 you enjoy some more good movies late- , E_S
11746:80	and \[ \[ I , \+ you know , we , \] \+ we \] keep *-1 saying oh yes , we feel 0 some day a woman will be president . E_S
11747:21	But , uh , I have some question , whether or not they will ever really get around to that . E_S
11884:61	\[ There , \+ there \] must be , uh , uh , \[ some of the , \+ some of the , \] uh , larger plants \[ up , \+ uh , up \] around one hundred twenty-eight . E_S
11945:70	and they thought 0 that was more beneficial because , you know \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ some of it \] does soak in E_S
11946:8	and some of it runs off right away \[ into the , \+ in to the \] streams and rivers E_S
11947:8	and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback . E_S
12066:82	The , uh , United States and Canada \[ \[ are I guess , \+ is , \] \+ is , \] going into , uh , some types of agreements * to limit , uh , what *T*-1 's being given *-2 out by power plants , E_S
12150:48	well you might , uh , generate some N_S yeah , E_S you might generate some interest in it . E_S
12479:52	I believe 0 he was the only one of fifty governors that *T*-1 voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back . E_S
12510:59	I mean , I 'd like *-1 to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region E_S
12525:180	and I think 0 that 's the problem 0 the P L O has *T*-1 is that \[ when they , \+ whenever one group of them \] decides that they 're going *-2 to negotiate , or they 're going *-3 to do something , they 're going *-4 to try *-5 to make some peace *T*-6 , \[ but , \+ \] uh , the end result is that \[ they , \+ there \] so many factions of them \[ and , \+ \] uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split , E_S
12525:280	and I think 0 that 's the problem 0 the P L O has *T*-1 is that \[ when they , \+ whenever one group of them \] decides that they 're going *-2 to negotiate , or they 're going *-3 to do something , they 're going *-4 to try *-5 to make some peace *T*-6 , \[ but , \+ \] uh , the end result is that \[ they , \+ there \] so many factions of them \[ and , \+ \] uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split , E_S
12525:298	and I think 0 that 's the problem 0 the P L O has *T*-1 is that \[ when they , \+ whenever one group of them \] decides that they 're going *-2 to negotiate , or they 're going *-3 to do something , they 're going *-4 to try *-5 to make some peace *T*-6 , \[ but , \+ \] uh , the end result is that \[ they , \+ there \] so many factions of them \[ and , \+ \] uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split , E_S
12913:29	and \[ he , \+ he \] likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah , E_S
12971:44	I think 0 my parents \[ have \+ have , \] uh , some of his records . E_S
12973:86	But , uh , \[ \[ I got a , \+ I 've \[ got about a hundred and , \+ or had \[ a , \+ uh , some , \] \] \] \+ uh ,
12974:12	I sold some of them ,
13212:19	There are , uh , some groups that *T*-1 have their children , you know , go away for a year . E_S
13224:29	\[ I , \+ we \] were doing some * investigating colleges
13263:27	Well , it seems that there 's some things like \[ the , \+ uh , the \] programs at least just go around \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] clean up streets \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things . E_S
13263:167	Well , it seems that there 's some things like \[ the , \+ uh , the \] programs at least just go around \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] clean up streets \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things . E_S
13326:20	and that is that N_S some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which I think 0 *T*-1 \[ is a , \+ is an \] invasion of privacy . E_S
13335:12	I get some of these things *ICH*-4 in the mail that I wonder , where in the world did they get my address *T*-2 or where did they get my name *T*-1 *T*-3 . E_S
13384:8	but some of them are sold *-1 , E_S
13389:10	and for some , N_S the reason they have three different names for me . N_S
13503:17	And if it 's some salesman , that just makes it even that much worse . E_S
13581:22	I knew 0 there was some type of a tie in there . E_S
13891:51	I think 0 they should either do that , \[ or , \+ or \] afford some time to the military , \[ or , \+ or \] *-1 helping elderly people . E_S
13897:97	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ you know , I \] think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that *T*-1 could use some help E_S
14550:18	And then they 're some sections kind of in the corner areas , E_S
14566:40	And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets , because a lot of those doctors have season tickets , E_S
14636:31	and he said , * sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes . E_S
14681:71	and what we have *-1 to do *T*-2 is , 0 we have *-3 to go , uh , *-4 get some stuff , steal it , and then , you know , just resell it . E_S
14745:78	we 're going *-1 to solve , try *-2 to solve the AIDS problem \[ while , \+ while , \] you know , some people are getting killed *-3 here and there E_S
14787:222	But the guy at the very top , the one \[ who *T*-1 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] really making the millions and the millions is the one who *T*-3 also many times is part of the power structure , uh , \[ the , \+ \] uh , and had the political uh , pull to \[ keep things from , \+ uh , keep \] the interest or the emphasis in some other direction , other than on the drug dealing , E_S
14880:26	I guess 0 I 've had some good experience and some bad experience with them . E_S
14880:35	I guess 0 I 've had some good experience and some bad experience with them . E_S
14933:37	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] talked to some who *T*-1 's really had some bad experience E_S
14933:57	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] talked to some who *T*-1 's really had some bad experience E_S
14980:11	compared to some of the other ones . E_S
15066:82	I mean , and it *EXP*-2 's nice * \[ to , \+ to \] try *-1 to teach young people \[ some , \+ some , \] uh , uh , civil , uh , consciousness ,
15071:91	so , I 'd have *-1 to say that , uh , \[ it , \+ you know , the people who *T*-2 do it , \] well , some feel 0 it 's rewarding . E_S
15127:14	like I do some volunteer work here and there , E_S
15172:30	I think that maybe that 's why some people do it *T*-1 is , uh , * to see the other cultures \[ or , \+ you know and \] some of that . E_S
15172:97	I think that maybe that 's why some people do it *T*-1 is , uh , * to see the other cultures \[ or , \+ you know and \] some of that . E_S
15188:66	after a certain amount of years of service , these employees can take off like six months or something , for some type of sabbatical or \[ \[ some , \+ you know , some , \] \+ something \] like that . E_S
15202:56	\[ it 's for , \+ I think , 0 at the same it 's for \] some people * to , you know , help them grow in other areas , E_S
15243:92	Everybody 0 I know *T*-1 has been , N_S well , I 'm going *-1 to go *-2 get a \[ goo- , \+ good \] job and make some money and buy a nice car . E_S
15293:19	she stuck my name on some list , E_S
15445:32	Now , I 've seen , you know , some different clips of it , um , E_S
15659:22	well , now , we had some friends that *T*-1 went *-2 to see it E_S
15665:36	I think 0 they may be playing up um , some aspects of the movie that *T*-1 are n't the main aspects . E_S
15752:19	Now we 've let some people *ICH*-1 go , uh , that \[ wa- , \+ we , \] \[ was \+ \] found that drugs were used *-2 in *T*-3 their system . E_S
15758:20	Uh , if there 's some , uh , problem I know , N_S
15779:43	And then I also had a friend who *T*-1 was just around some people that *T*-2 were smoking cocaine . E_S
15812:6	some of the places *ICH*-1 now , um , like I B M do n't allow them smoking , you know \[ in , \+ in \] the plant . E_S
15949:7	in some cases N_S
15964:42	I mean , and \[ they have , \+ they have \] some serious chemicals out there you know , E_S
15980:18	So I think 0 some \[ place , \+ you know , places \] like that , it should be like mandatory like , you know , \[ \[ on , \+ on a , \] \+ on a \] greater frequency than maybe , just , you know , paper pushers \[ like , \+ like \] I am *?* . E_S
16094:35	that 's what it said * to discuss *T*-1 some
16118:30	and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham E_S
16121:25	I was going *-1 to make some , uh , like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue . E_S
16129:5	some people like swiss , um , E_S
16227:51	and \[ \[ they , \+ they \] \+ MUMBLEx they \] go *-1 melt some chocolate chips , . E_S
16228:21	* Go *-1 buy me some strawberries . E_S
16258:63	\[ I think 0 the , \+ uh , actually I think 0 they \] get , um , some of them from South America . E_S
16324:6	some of them , they used *-1 to be a hundred dollars , E_S
16365:41	you put , um , really good vanilla favoring *ICH*-1 in it and some butter E_S
16386:26	\[ Ri- , \+ \] I have some . E_S
16479:14	and , um , some people do n't like \[ that , \+ that , \] film on the pudding E_S
16516:28	I was trying *-1 to think about some of my favorite people that I liked *T*-2 in music E_S
16548:27	\[ I , \+ I \] like some of his songs , though . E_S
16916:77	I mean , pretty much a lot of people would know about it , you know , \[ and , \+ and \] know some of the different things about it E_S
16917:44	but , uh , \[ they , \+ they \] might weed you out some other way . E_S
17027:15	he 's written some children 's books as well E_S
17246:8	For some reason that scared me more than anything . E_S
17338:17	and then he has some under , uh , another name . That he 's written *T*-1 . E_S
17367:44	and , after \[ I , \+ I \] graduated , I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through *T*-1 and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit , too , uh , E_S
17501:22	I 've , uh , Had some health problems that *T*-1 have led me to , uh , N_S
17660:63	Maybe if I can get interested in *-1 playing softball again this string I can , uh , start some type of , uh , regular program . E_S
17824:36	They 're always \[ in , \+ in \] Hawaii some place .
17870:41	I have n't watch any other ones on T V . Just on some of the tapes . E_S
17941:27	but there has got *-1 to be some kind of punishment , For these people . E_S
17979:30	Uh , they sure are *?* just because , some innocent person , can really , N_S
18056:61	\[ and , \+ but , \] I , do n't know what else * to do *T*-1 with some of these people , that *T*-2 are , N_S
18121:39	and people like Charles Manson , \[ and , \+ and \] some of these other people , who *T*-1 were sentenced *-2 to death at the time 0 they repealed the death penalty *T*-3 , were sentenced *-4 to life in prison , and are \[ now , \+
18275:22	* trying *-1 to get some color back in those , get the trees trimmed *-2 up , uh , get rid *-3 of a few weed problems and things like that . E_S
18416:39	in fact , we put in \[ some , \+ uh , some \] more roses yesterday . E_S
18466:131	just if you want a lot of , you know , light for underneath , that may be \[ the , \+ \] all right because \[ \[ we had , \+ because we have some , \] \+ we have some \] old fruit trees . E_S
18540:20	and they just , , have some \[ problems , \+ big time problems \] E_S
18601:25	they have *-1 to pay like some kind of fee per year . E_S
18611:7	and some places , \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] really nail them for tax . E_S
18679:111	\[ my , \+ my \] wife and I , \[ we planted \+ \[ on the , \+ on the \] south side \[ of our , \+ of our \] house we planted \] some gardenias . E_S
18722:34	\[ I , \+ I \] do , uh , some Lotus on it . Uh , do some , uh , Samna , some , uh , P F M , uh , nothing extremely complex . E_S
18722:56	\[ I , \+ I \] do , uh , some Lotus on it . Uh , do some , uh , Samna , some , uh , P F M , uh , nothing extremely complex . E_S
18722:70	\[ I , \+ I \] do , uh , some Lotus on it . Uh , do some , uh , Samna , some , uh , P F M , uh , nothing extremely complex . E_S
18791:25	I used it on , uh , some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased *-1 to leave it . E_S
18834:28	uh , E_S maybe you 'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things *T*-1 . E_S
18966:37	But I 'm sure that they can , uh , find some sort of , uh , use for them if , you know , you know , there , N_S
19175:22	And I 've seen where some places have taken a plastic *T*-3 and , uh , they 're recycling them into other plastics . And the Styrofoam also into insulation and things like that *T*-3 E_S
19189:72	and you 're not going *-1 to bother *ICH*-3 if you have one bag full , *-4 to drive all the way to some recycling center *-2 to turn in just your little plastic peanuts . E_S
19285:76	the evidence is that , uh , you know , \[ he 's , \+ he 's \] let \[ some , \+ some \] stuff *ICH*-1 go , you know , the east German situation . E_S
19303:14	it 's just some ungodly number * just to support the military machine . E_S
19334:139	and , you know , I even had a thought *ICH*-2 once that the whole Iraqi thing might have been just \[ a , \+ a \] deal *-1 to go ahead and let us , uh , you know , expend \[ some , \+ some \] military hardware . E_S
19388:44	and I think 0 he 's actually , honestly trying *-1 to do some change . E_S
19395:82	Well , this would be like if somebody was elected *-1 president of the United States and suddenly took off toward , you know , just some pretty hard by the socialism , E_S
19448:8	And some of the countries that *T*-1 were forced *-3 in at \[ th- , \+ \] later dates is the three Baltic countries , you know , 0 *T*-2 came \[ in , \+ in \] the forties , E_S
19509:16	You know , some reason or other , you know , is , uh ,
19543:12	they had some real fancy names for them . E_S
19590:19	Although , I 've seen some evidence that , you know , the , uh , the Russian soldiers are , N_S
19737:29	It was made *-2 * to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because , you know , \[ it was , \+ uh , if you read it , it only emancipated \] those who *T*-1 were in areas , uh , in rebellion against the United States . E_S
19768:12	where 's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played *T*-1 either leading up to *RNR*-2 or in *RNR*-2 the Civil War *T*-3 . E_S
19784:13	they were some groups of it , the Vicksburg , E_S
19785:106	if you ever get a chance * to go over to Vicksburg , the battleground at Vicksburg , uh , there 's an area \[ there where \+ there was , \] uh , some Texas , uh , groups *T*-1 E_S
19973:6	some of those get very philosophical E_S
20043:15	Um , well , some history , books are pretty scary , E_S
20089:20	Even better than JAWS and some of that ? E_S
20186:238	Well , I think 0 in a way , though , uh , uh , I also have , uh , an opposite point of view , which *T*-1 is , uh , 0 although I believe 0 we should , uh , permit , uh , you know , constant immigration into this country uh , \[ I think 0 we should , \+ uh , primarily for economic reasons , I think 0 we should \] have , um , some quotas , E_S
20214:27	There \[ are , \+ were \] some , uh , regulations *ICH*-2 over , E_S I do n't know whether they 're laws passed * \[ or , \+ or \] whatever they 're called *-4 *T*-1 , uh , just recently , where , uh , people with certain diseases can not be excluded *-5 , uh , from , uh , immigration *T*-3 . E_S
20220:49	So I think 0 \[ in , \+ in \] \[ some as- , \+ some \] ways we are , uh , becoming a little too egalitarian \[ in that , \+ in that \] sense , E_S
20350:44	I thought 0 maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there . E_S
20761:27	Well , I know that we have some relatives that *T*-1 live around , like the MUMBLEx area in there , E_S
20765:24	I know 0 they 're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there . E_S
20769:130	when they first started *-2 doing that in the paper , \[ and \+ \] I read about that *T*-1 , E_S I was just praying that , that would be in our area , because we 've been recycling for quite some time . E_S
20777:51	they 'll help you , recycle , because \[ we , \+ \] there is some bins , like behind Wal-Mart , that *T*-1 take some things . E_S
20777:80	they 'll help you , recycle , because \[ we , \+ \] there is some bins , like behind Wal-Mart , that *T*-1 take some things . E_S
20879:37	and so , you know , when I found out some places 0 * to take it *T*-1 *T*-2 , N_S
20880:33	and , um , like , um , they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there , E_S
20881:73	and I know that they 're going *-1 to use , you know , the money for that *-2 to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing . Put lights and stuff E_S
21056:15	but , uh , some of the crap that *T*-1 's on T V nowadays , it 's about . N_S
21159:16	I think 0 some of the tones of \[ the , \+ the \] daily prime time is questionable , E_S
21294:51	in fact , there was one show that he even turned down a date with some , you know , beautiful woman *T*-1 just because the idea that \[ he was , \+ his mind \] was on the ozone layer and , you know , global warming and all this other kind of stuff . E_S
22053:6	some of them are interested . E_S
22453:44	You did n't get a big kick out of *-1 killing them like some people do ? E_S
22479:112	so , I have not done , uh , much \[ freshwater fishing oh , for , \+ you know , \[ lake , \+ lake \] fishing for \] bass and so forth but , uh , maybe some what they call *T*-1 brim and those sorts of things , but nothing , N_S
22666:79	Of course what I used *-1 to like *-2 to do *T*-3 though is * go *-4 snorkeling for scallops *ICH*-5 in some of the bays , \[ or \+ uh , or \] \[ oy- , \+ for oysters . \] E_S
22692:30	So , we thought well , maybe there are some crab in here , E_S
22693:24	we 'll try *-1 to catch some crab . E_S
22733:57	I guess 0 the weirdest thing 0 I 've ever caught *T*-1 is , uh , in some of the inlets and the rivers around MUMBLEx Delaware . E_S
22835:54	But , um , we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted *-1 to give him some medication * to sort of , you know keep him real out of it all the time E_S
22968:14	Now there is some really nice ones . E_S
22969:26	There 's also , you know , some private ones , you know E_S
23028:35	and then on the other hand , I 've seen 0 some people go into the nursing home and * just so happy you know . E_S
23053:56	but I guess 0 once you get ill , then , you know , you really have some problems if you ca n't get around and do things . E_S
23171:117	* seems so much easier *ICH*-3 *-1 just to take it and throw it in the trash , and have them pick it up than it *EXP*-4 is *?* * to smash the cans and drive it some place * to have them . E_S
23212:31	but , um you know , occasionally we have some around , E_S
23264:36	I 'm sure 0 they 're probably doing that here some . E_S
23467:135	Well , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 basically we 're in a lot of agreement , uh , in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs , uh , some kind of legal definition . E_S
23477:25	maybe there ought *-1 to be some kind \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , MUMBLEx N_S
23544:59	And * \[ let 's , \+ you know , let 's \] get rid *-1 of some of this harassment suing . E_S
23576:17	It 's in there some place . E_S
23663:12	What are some of your favorite foods *T*-1 ? E_S
23667:30	I imagine 0 in Argentina you 've got some great foods . E_S
23674:35	\[ We got , \+ we got \] what some people call *T*-1 the best beef in the world . E_S
23895:103	And if you like Chinese food , you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some , uh , waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done , E_S
23895:131	And if you like Chinese food , you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some , uh , waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done , E_S
23945:10	Uh , some chopped up \[ scall- , \+ \] um , you know , slivers of scallions . And slivers of ginger .
24028:26	* Use the same hoi sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables . E_S
24088:35	depending upon the field , I know 0 there are some fields which a person should go to \[ the school , \+ that school , \] all four years *T*-1 , E_S
24089:24	but I know 0 there are some fields where it 's really not necessary *T*-1 . E_S
24225:42	And , um , I also have a good languages background , linguistics . And some psychology . E_S
24373:25	It never hurts * to have some kind of a grounding in law . E_S
24421:46	\[ I , \+ I \] thought 0 maybe you might have had some experience with the , uh , R C one thirty-fives . E_S
24451:17	They actually should do some reading E_S
24454:49	\[ and it , \+ And if it 's \] possible * even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it . E_S
24454:71	\[ and it , \+ And if it 's \] possible * even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it . E_S
24476:15	there are just some people that I , you know , N_S
24487:125	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] hate , um , *-1 having *-2 to play such a nice guy . You know , especially when it 's all phony *T*-3 . Especially when you got some , uh , jerk coming in *T*-4 . E_S
24597:29	If someone 's having personal problems *ICH*-2 for some reason that *T*-1 's causing them to \[ h- , \+ \] behave differently E_S
24612:128	\[ \[ and , \+ and \] it 's \+ and it 's \] based *-4 \[ on , \+ on \] a perception \[ that someone has *T*-3 \+ \] as how a drug user would behave *T*-2 when some drug users behave , uh , normal *T*-1 , uh , you know . E_S
24638:25	So see \[ I , \+ for some reason , I 've \] come up three times . E_S
24803:52	Well , that 's really too bad because \[ it , \+ it 's \] giving some people unfair advantage . E_S
24830:9	and some of \[ the , \+ the \] better parts of the Metroplex , \[ the , \+ the \] suburbs that *T*-1 are richer have those kind of target schools . E_S
24834:125	it 's like \[ if , \+ if \] your father owns a grocery store and you 're really interested in that , E_S there 's no reason that you should take college prep courses *T*-1 when you can get some general business courses in high school *T*-2 . E_S
24878:26	and , you know , there 's some kids that , you know , *T*-1 want *-2 to go *-3 learn , E_S
24943:14	I can see some lady , E_S
24991:33	maybe \[ we do , \+ we need \] some more Catholic schools , E_S
24994:15	In , uh , some places , uh , you could n't go to a public school . E_S
25042:19	Uh , we also have some two year college . E_S
25102:16	and I 'm not some kind of an idiot , E_S
25303:88	Well , um , oh , I guess 0 another thing 0 I 've noticed *T*-1 , too , here lately is that even though we 've had some pretty warm days , it 's been awfully gray , you know , just , N_S
25370:30	they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather . You know E_S
25508:57	and , uh , we 'll get out of the driving range \[ and , \+ and \] get some interest built *-1 up E_S
25637:32	And then , you know , we 've got some guys here that *T*-1 they are , you know , four and five handicappers E_S
26087:51	Well , * \[ Having , \+ having \] been out of the credit game for some years now , I 've gotten used to *-1 either paying in cash or not getting it . E_S
26317:56	\[ and , \+ and , \] \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] limited application in some respects . E_S
26650:33	or maybe * offer them , you know , some sort of an incentive * to do it . Uh , you know college credit , you know , something , you know , E_S
26760:65	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ that way , \+ *-1 handling it that way \] they could probably get some results out of it . E_S
26781:37	But , they would have *-1 to be supported *-2 in some way , E_S
26792:39	or would they really , you know , make a contribution of some kind . E_S
26844:30	and , I think , that they could get some results from that , because there are a lot of people who *T*-1 are volunteer and community minded , E_S
27002:15	I 've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy *T*-1
27081:6	some of them were even better behaved . E_S
27173:11	And consequently some of the very best students \[ were , \+ had \] excellent memories E_S
27358:66	I remembering *-2 reading a few cases about \[ that \+ \[ when it , \+ when \] \] some people first tried that *T*-1
27515:40	\[ and , \+ uh , and , \] in fact she put some right ba- , N_S
27536:16	and then they wanted some gray \[ * to do the , \+ *-1 to do the \] trim . E_S
27714:77	but \[ the , \+ the \] interesting thing is 0 that paint we wound up *-1 having *-2 to go back and scrape some of that away E_S
27784:137	I think 0 \[ with , \+ \] in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend , uh , *-1 to have a dramatic or story approach to their music , uh , usually tend *-2 to have some good or bad moral to it . E_S
27803:14	I listen to some country and western E_S
27810:100	but when I do play , uh , and begin *-4 to reacquire skills *T*-5 I inevitably fall in love with country western music which *T*-1 tends *-2 to be in some ways easy 0 * to play *T*-3 \[ for a , \+ for a \] new piano player . E_S
27827:8	for some reason \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] not a whole lot of his stuff that I 'm real crazy about *T*-5 , E_S
27828:16	but he does have some things . E_S
27829:11	Chicago had some things , E_S
27833:47	uh , and I think 0 even Electric Light Orchestra had \[ some , \+ some \] real , um , influences by classical music E_S
27838:29	I find it *EXP*-2 very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy *T*-1 I particularly like the music . E_S
27895:38	I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes *T*-1 E_S
27940:52	\[ I just , \+ you know , I can just \] drift off into some other world *-3 just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time 0 * to do that *T*-2 , E_S
28139:163	Because \[ if , \+ if \] I had been allowed *-1 to work , you know , maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week , I might still be working basically full time or part time , \[ if there was , \+ if there had been \] some way 0 *-3 to work it out *T*-2 , E_S
28305:5	some kids are really having it . N_S
28311:20	Un , you know some time day care is really good , E_S
28366:25	\[ Some of the , \+ some of the \] women 's roles , I think 0 *T*-2 , are almost for the worse , because we 're losing out on some things , *-1 going back to work , E_S
28366:97	\[ Some of the , \+ some of the \] women 's roles , I think 0 *T*-2 , are almost for the worse , because we 're losing out on some things , *-1 going back to work , E_S
28617:29	And we , uh , got a quote on some laser printers *ICH*-1 the other day at six hundred dollars . E_S
28732:27	and \[ the guys that , \+ some of the guys that \] *T*-1 run this place are very tight E_S
28754:51	I used *-1 to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall . E_S
29195:22	They need *-1 to put some sternness back \[ into the , \+ into the \] teachers and let them be able *-2 to , uh , get the old whip out and get some discipline . E_S
29195:103	They need *-1 to put some sternness back \[ into the , \+ into the \] teachers and let them be able *-2 to , uh , get the old whip out and get some discipline . E_S
29198:51	then it comes down to what you said *T*-1 before though about them being some of the lowest paid \[ public , \+ you know , public \] service , employees that there are *T*-2 , E_S
29226:97	Goodness gracious , if we would , uh , plan our expressways a little better , that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads , we 'd cut that in half and get some teachers
29245:55	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 we both agree 0 there 's some problems there E_S
29320:36	So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we 've had some very interesting conversations over lunch . E_S
29366:36	and they go back and forth , where everyone 's giving some opinions *T*-1 E_S
29390:27	\[ and , \+ and \] they shed some light on what *T*-1 was going on for me . E_S
29395:70	Um , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it *EXP*-3 \] was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe 0 * to grind *T*-1 , you know , E_S
29396:12	there were some that *T*-1 were screaming for air power , E_S
29397:12	there were some that *T*-1 were saying 0 the air power was n't going *-2 to do it . E_S
29555:18	and the other one has some weird ones that I 've never heard of *T*-1 . E_S
29611:26	People say * let me see some of your work . E_S
29649:11	I did some needlepoint years ago , E_S
29748:14	I 've seen some , E_S
29772:26	There 's bound *-1 to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that *T*-2 's very similar that *T*-3 's not going *-4 to melt too much with , uh , uh , high humidity , in a room , E_S
29936:8	But some things , especially letters , if they suggest certain colors for letters , I just go with whatever I want *-1 to *?* *T*-2 . E_S
30053:200	I know 0 \[ when I travel *T*-1 , \+ or when I used *-2 to travel overseas quite a bit *T*-3 , \] what I would do *T*-4 on my American Express card is \[ before I would , \+ before I left \] I would mail a check \[ to , \+ to \] American Express and , you know , have some idea of how much *T*-5 was there , you know ,
30223:41	\[ I , \+ I 've \] been doing it for twenty some odd years . E_S
30326:27	We have , you know , used some of it for some personal things . E_S
30326:39	We have , you know , used some of it for some personal things . E_S
30363:74	\[ Then , \+ you know , then , \] we thought , well we can use it for , you know , some personal things . E_S
30373:28	and , you know , it 's got some stuff on it . E_S
30374:49	It 's got a nice little word processing software on it , you know , and some budgeting type things and stuff . E_S
30428:39	there are \[ some \+ definitely , \[ some , \+ some \] \] advantages to it . E_S
30439:14	and we have some education programs that he likes *T*-1 . E_S
30532:36	I mean , E_S and then of course you have some changes 0 * to make *T*-1 , and do the whole thing over . E_S
30614:74	So . Anyway , \[ maybe , \+ you know , maybe \] \[ it 'll , \+ it 'll \] help in some way , E_S
30622:38	Well , I would like *-1 to get one at home some day . E_S
30624:22	and so , you know , some day I would like *-1 to get , even just like the video \[ tell , \+ \] or something like that , you know ,
30750:94	\[ \[ He was , \+ he 's \] \+ of course , uh , I guess 0 he 's \] trained in this , uh , martial arts of some sort , E_S
30806:60	\[ It was really , \+ I mean the Hollywood really must \] think 0 there 's some real dummies out there or something . E_S
30921:13	but they changed some things in the movie . E_S
30973:38	But \[ he , \+ he \] gets involved *-1 in some sort of bad dealings with somebody E_S
31014:9	in some of those , you know , \[ they , \+ I guess they \] retitled some movies that *T*-1 were going *-2 to be about Lebanese \[ \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ you know , and , \] \+ and \] Americans E_S
31014:60	in some of those , you know , \[ they , \+ I guess they \] retitled some movies that *T*-1 were going *-2 to be about Lebanese \[ \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ you know , and , \] \+ and \] Americans E_S
31115:59	And , uh , you know , \[ I , \+ I 've , \] in hindsight , seen some things that I wished that , you know , I had done something about *T*-1 that *T*-3 was , you know , within my power or , uh , you know , wish that in some ways we , as parents , had more control over what *T*-2 's happening up there , you know , type thing . E_S
31115:171	And , uh , you know , \[ I , \+ I 've , \] in hindsight , seen some things that I wished that , you know , I had done something about *T*-1 that *T*-3 was , you know , within my power or , uh , you know , wish that in some ways we , as parents , had more control over what *T*-2 's happening up there , you know , type thing . E_S
31131:48	But , uh , still \[ I , \+ I \] questioned the ability of some of the teachers * to , uh , really do a bang-up job , E_S
31191:38	and I would imagine 0 their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases . E_S
31208:111	are the rest of us who *T*-1 went for the big bucks , you know , staying out of , you know , where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated *-2 to spend some time *-4 teaching or something with these kids *T*-3 ? E_S
31215:25	Maybe there need *-1 to be some radical changes made * . E_S
31216:12	* Do some things that *T*-1 are totally different and unheard of . E_S
31255:86	and while it had , you know , a few little grammatical problems , it was n't very long and so forth . E_S I thought 0 it had some nice , well thought out , uh , parts to it . E_S
31414:30	I agree \[ that , \+ that \] some innocent person might be victimized *-1 , by a false test , E_S
31418:40	but I would think \[ that , \+ um , that \] some guidelines could be set *-1 up * to avoid that . E_S
31427:43	On the other hand , um , I think 0 there 's certainly some professions that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because \[ of the , \+ of their \] responsibility for the public welfare , and certainly people in , uh , industries , well , the transportation industry , \[ for spe- , \+ uh , you know , specifically . \] E_S
31471:13	and it takes some drastic steps at this point . E_S
31560:36	and there needs *-1 to be \[ some , \+ some \] measure of , uh , certainty before anything drastic happens . E_S
31577:86	so it seems to me \[ that , \+ that , \] um , there needs *-1 to be \[ some ground , \+ you know , some rules \] that *T*-2 protect . E_S
31604:11	would be some measure of protection . N_S
31611:69	Well , \[ \[ there 's , \+ yeah , there , \] \+ there 's \] going *-1 to be some measure of incentive , uh , reward or whatever , E_S
31697:38	I told my husband , I said , you go out some * to work on the car , E_S
31854:14	And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with , uh , dried red flowers and dried white flowers and , uh , eucalyptus . E_S
31924:29	You know , after a while you make some stuff , E_S
31942:39	and his , uh , son built him a garage and got him some , uh , oh , I do n't know what the equipment 's called *-1 *T*-2 , but planers and things and \[ s- , \+ set \] him up , E_S
32008:150	\[ \[ \[ and , \+ uh , so , \] \+ and , \] \+ uh , so \] as far as , you know , planting outdoor stuff , matter of fact , tonight \[ I just got through , \+ I was planting \] \[ some , \+ some \] trees out back tonight , E_S
32228:25	I made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe , E_S
32516:20	Next year I was planting some broccoli \[ and , \+ and \] some of those , they 're called *-2 \[ cabbage , \+ *RNR*-1 cabbage \] loppers , or whatever . E_S
32516:42	Next year I was planting some broccoli \[ and , \+ and \] some of those , they 're called *-2 \[ cabbage , \+ *RNR*-1 cabbage \] loppers , or whatever . E_S
32643:47	When we had our pool done *-1 *T*-2 I had them to leave some extra loam , you know , for my garden E_S
32734:49	We 've had a garden *ICH*-1 , gosh , for years and years and years , of some size , you know , E_S
32738:45	I ca n't remember a year when we did n't have one of some kind *T*-1 . E_S
32748:16	and I 've got some radishes up , E_S
32784:16	But we 've got some this year . E_S
32846:12	We let some turn red . E_S
32852:7	And some we do *T*-1 *-2 green E_S
32873:11	We planted some yellow peppers this year . E_S
32884:11	They have some little buds on them
32895:17	and I 've got some broccoli , uh , onions \[ some , \+ some \] radishes and , uh , uh , beets . E_S
32895:44	and I 've got some broccoli , uh , onions \[ some , \+ some \] radishes and , uh , uh , beets . E_S
32899:14	we 've got some beets , E_S
32919:38	\[ It takes a , \+ yeah , it does take some \] space . E_S
32925:20	MUMBLEx and I 've got some tomatoes still growing , \[ in , \+ in \] containers , E_S
32944:14	We 've got some good , um , um , Hybrid Burpee uh uh , pickler cucumbers E_S
33084:63	but \[ there 's , \+ uh , they 're \] a pain 0 * to peel *T*-1 for some people . E_S
33252:15	make hot dogs or some potato chips E_S
33313:50	one of the unique things in this it 's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings E_S
33440:12	I got some interesting information about crawfish E_S
33600:35	I was off for about six months too just for some other surgery 0 I 'd had *T*-1 , E_S
33824:10	There some things 0 I 'd like *-1 to try *T*-2 , E_S
33836:12	there was some girl there . E_S
33908:28	they tried *-1 to put me in some kind of immobilized walker , because he does n't like *-2 to put casts on when it 's warm *T*-3 . E_S
34037:123	Because \[ if , \+ if \] you 're going *-1 to go *-2 buy something , uh , uh , of that nature , I think 0 \[ you , \+ you 're \] going *-3 to have some idea as to what you 're going *-4 to do *T*-5 with it . E_S
34113:39	You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have , uh , competition . E_S
34184:41	But , uh , I think 0 there ought *-1 to be some rule against it . E_S
34289:33	\[ I can , \+ I can \] buy some , uh , today if I wanted *-1 to *?* . E_S
34467:48	but it was on a higher level , you know , where there were some things that kids did n't understand *T*-1 that adults did *T*-2 *T*-3 , E_S
34581:32	and \[ there were , \+ there were \] some definite , um , should I say *RNR*-1 , tense moments , with him in there . E_S
34829:125	See , \[ that 's the one , \+ that is \] \[ the \+ honest to God the \] one reason 0 I do n't want *-1 to see the movie *T*-2 is because I love buffalos for some weird reason , E_S
35054:22	you know , you watch some of the cartoons , E_S
35099:36	\[ I sit , \+ I sit \] and watch some shows , E_S
35533:49	and , uh , if I consider *-1 going the used car route and save up some money , I should n't have too much trouble at all . E_S
35544:26	and I was picking up , uh , some background noise , E_S
35642:30	And so she 's going *-1 to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try *-2 to make as much down payment as possible *-2 to keep the monthly payment low . E_S
35642:46	And so she 's going *-1 to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try *-2 to make as much down payment as possible *-2 to keep the monthly payment low . E_S
35921:146	I mean , I 've always felt that people on welfare should be required *-1 to spend \[ at least part of their time , \+ not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity * to look for a job , but at least some of their time \] \[ * to look for , \+ *-2 to go out \] and clean up the roads . You know , E_S
36032:51	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 there ought *-1 to be some kind of assistance as far as , uh , N_S
36280:40	I think 0 youngsters ought *-1 to go out and do some public service , E_S
36325:14	* Play golf some , E_S
36357:14	I do walk some too . E_S
36387:36	we 've , uh , just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment . E_S
36566:33	and we were hoping , uh , *-1 to do some camping in the van , um , E_S
36577:17	um , up here some of the state parks are really nice E_S
36578:8	and some of them are n't *?* , E_S
36579:6	some of them are pretty rough . E_S
36587:8	but some of them are really nice E_S
36703:9	just some of them are known E_S
36884:36	I mean \[ some , \+ I think 0 some \] people that *T*-1 had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , I think 0 they stayed . E_S
37194:10	But in some ways I think 0 we are expected *-1 to do it all . E_S
37233:25	I mean , I 've done some of both . E_S
37253:74	But , uh , even now , \[ I would , \+ I would \] like *-1 to not have *-2 to work in some ways . E_S
37319:46	\[ I , \+ well I \] see , I think 0 *T*-2 some people wanting *-1 to stay home more and take care of the children . E_S
37585:99	it seems that what you really need *-1 to do *T*-2 *-3 to win though , is * to have a team that *T*-4 has reasonable talent and has some people that *T*-5 \[ \[ have , \+ have , \] \+ have \] real breakthrough years . E_S
37736:14	'cause I did some teaching part-time E_S
37766:94	what *T*-1 gets me is 0 I ca n't believe that \[ Congress , \+ uh , or , our state legislature \] ca n't come up with , uh , some kind of workable means 0 * to have funds for the school *T*-2 . E_S
37814:65	Not if you can read or write , \[ or do , \+ or \[ un- , \+ understand \] \] some science . N_S
38022:14	and I process some ratings and \[ put , \+ do \] graphics for their television stations , MUMBLEx their clients , E_S
38030:56	It 's basically just data entry and * running , you know , \[ some , \+ some \] software E_S
38275:22	I had *-1 to do some of my husband 's papers because I had access to one E_S
38377:55	and I 've got lots of documentation 0 I need *-1 to review *T*-2 and some 0 I need *-3 to revise *T*-4 . E_S
38546:39	but that has a little bit 0 *T*-1 to do with some of the things that I read *T*-2 . E_S
38557:11	Right now some of the things 0 I 'm working with *T*-1 are kids that *T*-2 are dealing with sexual abuse , E_S
38606:37	I 've always wanted *-1 to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um , because I enjoyed some of those stories so much , E_S
38606:73	I 've always wanted *-1 to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um , because I enjoyed some of those stories so much , E_S
38616:30	Um , I trying *-1 to think of some of my other favorite books , E_S
38757:28	It 's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that . E_S
38808:24	I \[ do \+ do \] some crafts like it mentioned in the thing , E_S
38813:27	I was trying *-1 to think of some \[ while , \+ while \] it was , uh , talking about it , E_S
38863:14	and I did some of that .
38884:41	\[ I 've , \+ I 've , \] uh , made some small things , cross stitch things . E_S
38892:19	But I have recently done some cross stitch . E_S
38901:14	I 've done some \[ cross , \+ um , cross \] stitch , E_S
38912:34	\[ I was , \+ I was \] making some little things for Christmas , E_S
38943:28	and I thought I better *T*-1 do some simple things and work up to this because it *EXP*-3 was just so difficult * to get it done *-2 . E_S
38956:17	And I 've done some of the crewel and \[ the , \+ \] um something similar to that E_S
38990:62	and whenever I go *-1 visit my parents *T*-2 , they 're always saying , Well , * bring some of your tapes . E_S
39000:22	and they said , * Bring some tapes with you . E_S
39014:24	in the winter time I usually plant some pansies in there , E_S
39023:24	I probably should go *-1 buy some . E_S
39027:44	I guess 0 if I had a house I might enjoy gardening , some . E_S
39095:57	So . I think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be nice * to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch . E_S
39155:39	I 'd love *-1 to \[ have , \+ have \] some animals . E_S
39372:27	and then I mix up , uh , some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta wi- , and some cool whip , E_S
39372:59	and then I mix up , uh , some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta wi- , and some cool whip , E_S
39499:32	* mix up a little , uh , mayonnaise with some dijon mustard , and honey until it just , N_S
39558:60	we might try *-1 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ um , to \] grill some flounder or salmon steaks . E_S
39592:38	Sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips , just over it , and some red onion slices , and just a little bit of , um , basil , and then a little Italian dressing over it . E_S
39620:16	And you can put some cucumber slices on too . E_S
39679:13	I stir fried some the other night though . E_S
39720:28	Cause , we have \[ some , \+ some \] local ones . E_S
39952:53	\[ They did n't have , \+ they did n't have \] *-1 to go through some tough games during the year E_S
40601:76	she gets home visitations by the \[ s- , \+ \] MUMBLEx I do n't know , the state boards , I guess , some of them and then some by the association , E_S
40601:91	she gets home visitations by the \[ s- , \+ \] MUMBLEx I do n't know , the state boards , I guess , some of them and then some by the association , E_S
40661:62	\[ and \+ \] he just really missed *-1 being able *-2 to be by himself , and having some peace and quiet E_S
40672:26	we all need that time , just some quiet time 0 *-1 to wind down from the day *T*-2 . E_S
40919:8	and some of those other places I would n't have *?* . E_S
41356:63	I think 0 there was four or five different people , that *T*-1 would call , you know , some of them , if they did n't have their addresses and all on them , E_S
41495:41	it has everybody that you could ever imagine *T*-1 , and some 0 you could n't *?* *T*-2 . E_S
41534:24	I just remember 0 they had some funny stories , E_S
41541:27	but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents *T*-1 , then \[ you can find out from , \+ you know , you can find somebody \] else that *T*-2 can tell you something else about these , E_S
41620:12	but , for some reason a mini skirt is , to me a little more unprofessional 0 * to wear *T*-1 to work than jeans E_S
41643:12	There are some that *T*-1 are really short E_S
41644:17	and then there are some that *T*-1 may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee . E_S
41685:67	Well I feel like too , on the job , when , you know , there 's men around and some of the managers are men *T*-1 , \[ you just , \+ you know , you \] do n't want them looking at your legs necessarily . E_S
42099:19	the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas , you know . E_S
42116:7	some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do *T*-1 , \[ it 's just , \+ it just \] gets out of hand , E_S
42150:39	Uh , I ca n't remember what the town was *T*-1 , some little area . E_S
42437:36	but somewhere we 've got *-1 to come up with some money \[ * to build , \+ *-2 to build \] more , you know , and keep these people in them , you know . E_S
42474:28	Because there has got *-1 to be some kind of background check * to see , that the people who *T*-2 are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose , you know ,
42591:73	and , \[ I guess \+ I think , \] 0 the other thing that we ought *-2 to control *T*-1 to some extent is , 0 there should be some law against the types of gu- , N_S
42591:97	and , \[ I guess \+ I think , \] 0 the other thing that we ought *-2 to control *T*-1 to some extent is , 0 there should be some law against the types of gu- , N_S
42592:16	I mean , some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put *T*-1 out , \[ that *T*-2 are \+ , \[ pie- , \+ \] I mean , they 're are \] N_S
42615:120	I mean , there are a lot of kids who when they 're ten *T*-2 *T*-1 look like they 're twelve , or fourteen \[ or , \+ \[ and , \+ and , \] \] especially some of the minority children . Whether , you know a racist or not , E_S
42623:26	\[ And , \+ And \] if some of them are doing something that they should n't be *?* *T*-1 and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands E_S
43012:80	\[ It would be an interesting , \+ it *EXP*-2 would be even more interesting \] \[ you , \+ you \] to be some of these people who *T*-1 are at the other end of the spectrum . E_S
43129:43	this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt , and some Saint Augustine . E_S
43373:12	I know some friends who *T*-1 went *-2 to see it . E_S
43525:44	You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things *T*-1 . E_S
43608:12	What are some other ones 0 I 've seen *T*-1 lately *T*-2 . E_S
43639:90	I just go *-1 to be entertained *-2 E_S \[ and \+ and \] not really interested in \[ some of the , \+ like the TERMINATOR or some of the \] Schwarzenegger stuff . E_S
43781:12	There 's some nice stuff *ICH*-2 over there 0 * to see *T*-1 . E_S
43804:15	Here 's *T*-1 some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field . E_S
43867:9	Probably some of them did . E_S
43983:29	it 's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles , on the back and there 's some sort of stone or something in the front E_S
43983:65	it 's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles , on the back and there 's some sort of stone or something in the front E_S
44002:6	some of the home builders are , N_S
44039:33	and \[ we have , \+ we have \] some more that *T*-1 need *-2 to be done *-3 , E_S
44061:8	And some of still has *-1 to be redone *-2 . E_S
44088:17	So we still have some of that trim work 0 * to do *T*-1 because we put it off all this time , E_S
44479:79	are you willing *-1 to compromise a little \[ and , \+ and \] \[ \[ pay , \+ pay \] some , \+ take some \] of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education . E_S
44674:38	Uh , \[ and , \+ and , \] you know , some people might not believe that E_S
44690:13	Well , for some reason during the night , the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through E_S
44885:39	And \[ ma- , \+ maybe \] * let them have some mock , I mean uh , you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start *-1 really young . E_S
44922:19	and people are finally taking some action against it . E_S
44935:38	I mean , I 'm sure 0 you heard about some of ours . E_S
45020:14	and you have some success and want *-1 to go on *-2 learning and continue *-2 learning , uh and not wait until they 're in high school E_S
45052:41	And , okay , \[ this , \+ this \] candidate tells you some things that *T*-1 are going *-2 to happen E_S
45056:18	and this candidate tells you some things . E_S
45082:8	Now some people object during primaries , *-1 having *-2 to declare a party , whether Republican or Democrat E_S
45095:206	and , uh , I do think 0 more needs *-2 to be done *-3 along that line * to help * to , uh , teach the \[ people , \+ uh , uh , everyone , \] uh , more about what *T*-1 is going on with voting and with nonvoting . So that , uh , \[ we can make , \+ they 're making \] some more intelligent decisions . E_S
45381:15	I mean , some maybe N_S
45774:33	Now , they 've been able *-1 to get some good players and come around E_S
46121:25	if you get *-1 to watch some of these , N_S
46234:17	\[ Some , \+ some \] places do have guard gates that you have *-1 to get through *T*-2 , or electronic access gates and things like that .
46314:8	and some of those people , they do n't deserve *-1 to be let *-2 loose . E_S
46360:51	Sometimes when you lose someone that you really love *T*-1 *T*-2 , you do some crazy things E_S
46428:48	I went to the Far East , uh , back in October *-1 to do some training for T I E_S
46433:11	uh , some of those countries were so safe , 0 it was unreal . E_S
46596:16	and especially not in some of these big cities , E_S
46839:12	There 's some kind of problems . E_S
46951:17	but supposedly they have some real wood built * in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel , E_S
47133:13	and there 's some real nice ones in Arkansas . E_S
47168:41	so , I 'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting . E_S
47212:13	and there 's some pretty decent campgrounds although , \[ I do n't think 0 Raleigh , \+ I do n't think 0 the state \] of North Carolina takes , N_S
47248:54	\[ The , \+ uh , the \] movie , THE DOORS , has \[ so- , \+ some \] nice desert scenes , E_S

47415:122	\[ speaking of Bush , \+ we 're going *-1 to get a little off topic but * speaking of Bush , \] \[ they \+ that \] had a story where he went *-2 to visit some little , uh , elementary school students , and stuff *T*-3 . E_S

47579:19	then my father got us some tickets , E_S
47841:8	and some of the people in our church use birth control E_S

48344:84	Most of that 's done *-1 with rifles and such . Uh , though there 's , you know , probably I 'm sure 0 *T*-3 some sector that *T*-2 does it with handguns . E_S
48360:26	but I guess 0 it would be some . E_S

49864:52	Uh , they still have \[ \[ some , \+ some , \] \+ uh , some \] draft picks , uh , that they got *T*-1 , E_S
49871:19	Actually , they picked up some from Minnesota . E_S
49898:45	and every once in a while * gets a chance * to talk to some of the guys E_S
50231:57	\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] I do n't have any doubt that through some back channels \[ that \+ \] we encouraged it . You know . E_S
50333:30	and what *T*-2 's wrong is right in some cases . E_S
50366:31	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 some of these people that they claim *T*-1 as Middle Eastern experts \[ do n't , \+ do n't \] have a clue sometimes . E_S
50452:133	You know , \[ we , \+ we 've \] got folks running around here \[ who *T*-1 get , \+ who *T*-2 get \] degrees in basket weaving and you know , underwater psychology , or \[ some , \+ some \] ridiculous stuff like that . E_S
50686:55	but there are an awful lot of young people who *T*-1 would benefit from , um , some sort of public service , like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or , uh , various other things of that sort . E_S
50704:33	It *EXP*-3 would be great * to have some of those organizations like 0 you mentioned *T*-1 that *T*-2 were during the Depression or coming out of the Depression available for kids . E_S
50705:24	And I think 0 there are some available now where they are able *-1 to work *T*-2 , E_S
50717:7	And some people would get military service E_S
50718:7	and some people would get civilian , uh , service , like * working in hospitals . E_S
50775:30	and then you have *-1 to pay them some kind of a stipend ,
50845:44	Um , well , like I say , I know that there are some type of programs that they have *T*-1 available for \[ a youth , \+ like teenagers \] to go and do , um , work in the national parks and work in , uh , neighborhoods *-2 to \[ do , \+ \] um , clean up and that sort of thing . E_S
51230:48	I mean , the guy 's twenty , twenty-five home rums , maybe thirty , eighty some R B I-s . E_S
51336:82	you know , I kind of wish that they had inter league play , like they do in all the other sports so I could see some of the National League teams here once in a while . E_S
51558:12	they had some other expenses that *T*-1 came up E_S
51578:33	and , um , it had been recommended *-1 by some friends of ours E_S
51684:29	I mean , he has always got some kind of , cold or something . E_S
51752:21	\[ and , \+ and \] some kid goes out and gets the kid E_S
51879:11	You get some kids in there E_S
52077:5	some , I guess like , N_S
52128:61	Now , \[ I , \+ I \] also liked , uh , oh , GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic , like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA . E_S
52288:14	I mean some of them are done *-1 good E_S
52640:64	and * having sat on both , uh , uh , criminal *RNR*-1 and a civil *RNR*-1 , uh , jury , some of what *T*-2 goes through our courts is a total waste of time . E_S
52655:41	I would like *-1 to see \[ \[ some , \+ some \] kind of reform , \+ or some kind of streamlining \] so that , if a person is , um , convicted *-2 , and sentenced *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] death , \[ that \+ that \] automatic appeal which *T*-3 goes in could be more quickly dealt with *-4 . E_S
52655:63	I would like *-1 to see \[ \[ some , \+ some \] kind of reform , \+ or some kind of streamlining \] so that , if a person is , um , convicted *-2 , and sentenced *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] death , \[ that \+ that \] automatic appeal which *T*-3 goes in could be more quickly dealt with *-4 . E_S
52990:22	I know 0 there are some good places 0 * to go *-2 camping *T*-1 along \[ the , \+ uh , the \] lakes . E_S
53230:88	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] left T I in January *-1 hoping *-2 to strike out and find a job where I could make some money *T*-3 . E_S
53395:29	\[ I , \+ sometimes I \] hear some things \[ on , \+ on \] the radio . E_S
53606:11	We got some awful rain , uh , the other morning . E_S
53610:10	Uh , some real massive thunderstorms . E_S
53614:59	Apparently , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too . E_S
53618:11	* Caused some damage . E_S
53622:14	We may get some more tonight . E_S
53634:14	we 're getting some flooding . E_S
53697:15	You 've got some kids that *T*-1 'll pick up on it in the first three minutes 0 you 're talking about it *T*-2 , E_S
53722:5	some are really going *-1 to be heavy into reading . E_S
53859:39	\[ Instead of , \+ \] there has *-1 to be some sort of discipline , E_S
53860:24	and there has *-1 to be some sort of punishment . Short of * physically isolating the child , and short of * physically hitting the child . E_S
53921:15	I mean , some kids do n't get do n't get spanked *-1 at home E_S
53922:7	and some kids need *-1 to be spanked *-2 at home . E_S
54010:82	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 mostly as far \[ as , \+ as \] crafts go , I 've done , um , some needlepoint . E_S
54025:19	Just when I get some spare time here and there *T*-1 I 'll work on it , E_S
54082:30	and during the week they go back and do some more . E_S
54381:12	There are some Kurds living in Iran . E_S
54385:32	and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid . E_S
54472:148	\[ I keep , \+ you know , um , you know , there 's like three movies that \[ I , \+ I \] keep \] *-1 telling myself that I should see *T*-2 \[ one of these , \+ \] you know , some day that I have n't seen *T*-3 , you know , \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-5 are classics , you know . E_S
54518:41	\[ there 's , \+ there is , \] you know some blood and everything E_S
54648:44	When you think of what it takes *T*-1 * to make some of those kind of movies *T*-2 , you know . N_S
54847:12	How about some of the ads , E_S
54872:38	so , we 're probably going *-1 to like rent those some time and then try *-2 to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere . E_S
55034:11	uh , some of them did n't E_S
55084:23	In a way Aikman has done some of that . E_S
55126:16	Boy , they 'd some big changes , * speaking of them . E_S
55165:39	Uh , Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes , because of some of the stupid stuff 0 he does *T*-1 , E_S
55224:111	And my reasons are based *-1 upon not only \[ from \+ \] \[ what I read *T*-2 in the newspapers , \+ what I see *T*-3 on the newspapers , \] but up against some of the , fun and exciting things 0 I ran into *T*-4 during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group . E_S
55289:86	There 's probably five or six , which *T*-1 would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs , that *T*-2 are in positions over some of these Soviet states . E_S
55316:28	But on a highly populated area , like some of the Soviet cities would be *?* , with the weaponry that *T*-1 's attached *-2 on those things , there is no place 0 * to hide *T*-3 . E_S
55334:34	But , during that same time frame , did n't you get some feeling , that , I mean , they 're getting all these weapons and stuff ? E_S
55391:26	and he 's had his problems with some of the old guard himself . E_S
55897:52	Uh , and I find ways 0 *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] turn some of that back \[ to , \+ to \] others *T*-2 . E_S
55924:11	it gave some folks some jobs , E_S
55924:16	it gave some folks some jobs , E_S
55925:13	and we got some great public works out of it . E_S
55938:34	And this would give them a chance *-1 to have some positive self-esteem . E_S
55952:54	You take pride in that , \[ and , \+ and \] get \[ some , \+ some \] positive feedback from those *ICH*-2 who *T*-1 benefit , besides yourself . E_S
56008:41	And I can see , you know , \[ some , \+ some \] really significant things coming out of it . E_S
56059:56	and I thought 0 I had seen , when we were traveling around the state *T*-1 , some similar signs *ICH*-2 up that *T*-3 indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up *-4 E_S
56078:32	And \[ they , \+ they 've \] started some recycling campaigns that *T*-1 a year before that had been turned down *-2 because they said , Well , it 's not feasible , E_S
56108:55	But , it *EXP*-1 is comforting to me * to see , uh , more concern about some of these things \[ that , \+ that *T*-2 \] cost us money . E_S
56116:70	it *EXP*-1 's just probably a good thing that the oil 's burning and \[ may , \+ may , \] make some people realize that hey , you know , this stuff runs out . E_S
56139:87	Uh , or we 'll suddenly be in the dark and say , Oh , my goodness , now we do n't have the ability * to go on to some new technology . E_S
56204:26	and you put a bay leaf and put some , uh , red pepper over it . E_S
56209:19	or you can just get some , you know , regular red peppers . E_S
56322:79	And while that 's cooking , I take \[ mayonnaise , \+ about a cup of mayonnaise , \] and a teaspoon of mustard , and some garlic powder , E_S
56324:16	And I shred up some just regular white cheese . E_S
56381:43	And , uh , usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up , and put some color into it , you know , E_S
56423:26	Oh . You ought *-1 to try some crawfish . E_S
56665:84	Um , you do n't even have *-1 to go all the way to New Orleans , you know , if you want *-2 to really get some good food . E_S
56692:21	And , uh , I have some friends that *T*-1 live down there . E_S
56817:32	and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them E_S
56850:10	uh , some countries voting is obligatory . E_S
56905:7	And some people do n't vote , E_S
56910:20	but you 're eligible for some sort of fine if you do n't vote . E_S
57078:62	And , uh , he makes a very , uh , passionate , good argument for why you do n't want some things decided *-1 by democratic process *T*-2 , E_S
57082:16	if there 's some minority that people do n't like *T*-1 because of , you know , racial hatred or something like that , the majority can just simply \[ vote again- , \+ vote against \] them . E_S
57196:74	I believe 0 at I B M \[ they , \+ they \] make 0 you wear a blue suit and , uh , some kind of colored shirt and a tie . E_S
57215:41	and he 'll be over there until July first *-1 setting up some kind of computers for them . E_S
57412:48	it had , uh , \[ leather , \+ leather \] designs and , um , some \[ other , \+ other \] little things on it E_S
57469:14	And that was some time ago , E_S
57651:111	I 'm convinced that , uh , Detroit or whoever it is *T*-1 made a major mistake , years ago when they stopped *-2 putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes *T*-3 . E_S
57659:64	I 'm convinced that the small V eight like \[ the , \+ the \] Mustang 's original two eighty-nine or some of the Chevy two eighty-threes , were good little V eight engines that *T*-1 were not gas guzzlers E_S
57863:29	Um , * looking back , like maybe some of the things that I know *T*-1 now , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not sure 0 I do believe 0 it was worth the cost in dollars and lives . E_S
57999:88	\[ i- , \+ if \] they could just cut out all the fat \[ and , \+ and \] get it lean , and start *-1 addressing some of the other issues , E_S I think 0 *T*-2 we could take care of everything . And quit *-3 taking care of all these other countries all across the world , you know , who *T*-4 just end up *-5 using things against us later on anyway . E_S
58112:22	And \[ som- , \+ for some \] reason those people do n't see that . E_S
58286:70	and America does have a long history of * sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting , you know , some other model . E_S
58412:16	Um , I do some every now and then , E_S
58705:6	some of the stuff is good , E_S
58814:28	\[ ye- , \+ you \] take some of the batter out and give it to someone else E_S
59322:11	and then some of the bigger companies , N_S
59429:38	and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems . E_S
59675:12	he had some cocaine and \[ th- , \+ \] \[ it \+ \] was accused *-1 of * selling it , E_S
59733:43	I wonder if a judge did n't have control of that if some of that would change , you know . E_S
59814:135	And then \[ \[ we 'll have all , \+ we 'll have , \] \+ we will have \] the money if we would do that * \[ to , \+ to \] work on your own system because we 've got some serious problems here E_S
60112:20	my brother had asthma and some allergies which I think 0 he 's outgrown *T*-1 now , E_S
60149:37	I could see \[ some \+ *-1 having , maybe some \] of the tropical fish , that *T*-2 are really , really pretty E_S
60478:27	\[ and , \+ and \] that has some opportunities E_S
60705:37	And maybe I 'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I do n't get laid *-1 off between now and then . E_S
60738:38	on channel thirteen , uh , they had \[ some , \+ some \] programs the day before , E_S
60768:31	but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of \[ the , \+ \] um , what they do *T*-1 , uh , *-2 to , uh , make their dough and \[ st- , \+ \] to , clean out the flour and stuff like that , E_S
60778:8	and some of the people that *T*-1 work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming *T*-2 they , you know , shut down everything E_S and they clean up their act , but on a normal basis \[ that they 're , \+ that they 're \] dumping things , that they 're not supposed *-1 to be dumping *T*-2 , E_S
60864:47	So , I do n't see , you know , how they can do some of the te- *T*-1 , N_S
60986:35	and \[ the , \+ the \] ground will filter some of it but not all of it . E_S
61316:40	\[ we , \+ we \] were trying *-1 to find some pictures of him recently . E_S
61530:74	So , uh , \[ we got , \+ \[ we , \+ we \] put \] dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it , you know , so that he could n't get out . E_S
61624:25	and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason . E_S
61694:30	And also I 'm interested in * writing some programs that *T*-1 will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like . E_S
61878:40	and just recently I 've changed my job * to actually do some of the marketing . E_S
61968:36	but \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] got some opinions on it . E_S
61995:5	some type of college , uh , volunteer work for teachers , that *T*-1 they are straight out of college E_S
62026:5	some group paid part of his college income E_S
62048:41	you know , \[ if , \+ if \] we had some really major health problem that *T*-1 required a specialist , we could find one
62145:60	but say , I think 0 Bangladesh *ICH*-1 would have been a good example or \[ some , \+ some \] really desperate situation E_S
62211:96	And maybe rather than * just , require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like , um , during college , you know , * maybe have some kind of course where they 'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work , and help people in that area or people in the United States *T*-2 . E_S
62211:137	And maybe rather than * just , require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like , um , during college , you know , * maybe have some kind of course where they 'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work , and help people in that area or people in the United States *T*-2 . E_S
62215:25	but I wonder if there are n't some sociology courses . E_S
62280:63	So , we 're a little \[ fa- , \+ you know , farther \] removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing *T*-1 . E_S
62302:24	so , we 'll talk about that some . E_S
62358:56	Well , we bought a computer because my husband needed *-1 to use it * to do some work for a consulting project , E_S
62424:8	In some ways it has more *-2 to do with the people who *T*-1 sold it . E_S
62467:51	and they say 0 they can , you know , do something different and change some connectors E_S
62484:17	So , well , actually some things are pretty good with that because I put it on a gold credit card E_S
62494:82	but that 's one thing 0 *T*-2 to be said *-1 for credit . E_S \[ It , \+ how , it \] gets you some muscle where you need it *T*-1 *T*-3 . E_S
62544:33	but * to keep her entertained , music and some of these things do help . E_S
62548:100	And I thought well , if I had , uh , \[ a nic- , \+ a nice \] little , um , tape recorder , you know , so that I could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while . And then also so that \[ \[ I can , uh , uh , copy , uh , parts off , \+ I , \] \+ I do \] some musicals and things like this and if I can copy sections off that 0 I can use *T*-1 someplace \[ so \+ \] I figured well this will be good . E_S
62594:19	Do you buy it at some major store ? E_S
62849:29	and then I was having *-1 to work some real late hours *-1 to get caught with my work after I got out of class . E_S
62853:41	And then I went to Colorado Springs the next week *-1 to do some training at the T I up there . E_S
62885:8	and some of them require me to go out of town , E_S
62998:35	Um , E_S it 's a lot more fun than some other things 0 I could do *T*-1 , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
63163:19	Uh , E_S they have some \[ during , \+ during \] lunch hour that *T*-1 are shorter , E_S
63174:15	they even have some late night ones for people that *T*-1 work second shift and things like that . E_S
63176:14	They even have some , uh , \[ aerobic , \+ uh , water aerobics \] when the weather gets nice *T*-1 out in the pool . E_S
63193:46	and I think 0 they 're working on *-1 building a jogging track and some other things . E_S
63260:17	and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter . E_S
63319:95	I would expect people with any kind of buying power \[ over the age , \+ you know , under the age \] of thirty or so , to have some idea what it is *T*-1 , anyway . E_S
63382:11	And then some of them are done *-1 in , you know , purely metric . E_S
63481:24	now , okay , we run into some problems once , E_S
63581:7	and some are in kilometers . E_S
63593:18	and they 've got some great big bins there for newspaper , um , plastic , um , I think three bins for glass , white , green , and \[ whatev- , \+ whatever \] other combination there is *T*-1 . E_S
63596:63	\[ And , \+ and \] I think 0 they 've got \[ a comp- , \+ \] uh , some kind of container for aluminum . E_S
63690:51	And I think 0 they 're trying *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] make some changes . E_S
63740:30	\[ I , \+ I \] wonder about some of the \[ prod- , \+ products \] that they do n't take *T*-1 , like some of the plastics and things that they do n't take *T*-2 . Uh , \[ why , \+ why \] they could n't do more recycling with those *T*-3 . E_S
63740:81	\[ I , \+ I \] wonder about some of the \[ prod- , \+ products \] that they do n't take *T*-1 , like some of the plastics and things that they do n't take *T*-2 . Uh , \[ why , \+ why \] they could n't do more recycling with those *T*-3 . E_S
64077:19	The other day we had some hail , the biggest hail 0 I 've ever seen *T*-1 in Texas . E_S
64249:28	But if I were *-1 to live some place else , it certainly meets my standards . E_S
64345:11	they have some pretty nice weather out there in Los Angeles .
64391:18	And they 've built some new highways out to that area , and things , lately . E_S
64749:24	and I hope 0 you get some more calls and make some more calls . E_S
64749:36	and I hope 0 you get some more calls and make some more calls . E_S
65044:48	And I \[ hope 0 we , \+ hope 0 we \] did them some good , uh , on their little computer dealy . E_S
65143:6	some of those books are real tough 0 * to get into *T*-1 , E_S
65240:13	does he get some royalties from that , hopefully ? E_S
65456:58	It 's , uh , something 0 we 're really irritated about *T*-1 around here . E_S Or some people are really irritated about *T*-1 . E_S
65698:44	I would like *-1 to be a little more into * investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems . And * to come up with something a little better than what we 've got *T*-2 . E_S
65715:56	But I 'm just saying that even the differences , uh , is that , you know , some countries pay for students to go \[ to , \+ through \] college and etcetera . E_S
65777:13	So we had some interference , E_S
65787:148	but , uh , you know , I think , 0 uh , \[ they , \+ maybe they \] need *-2 to , uh , help *-3 promote that more . Give incentives like , uh , if they do bring somebody on , they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is *T*-1 , you know , for them to train people , you know , stuff like that .
65796:26	But see , that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people . \[ At people , per , \+ at high school level , \] which I would like *-1 to see *T*-2 . Rather than so many kids getting out of school . E_S
65921:58	\[ I , \+ uh , I 'm \] trying my best right now *-1 to pay off some of mine . E_S
65926:36	\[ And , \+ uh , but \] still I have some that *T*-1 \[ are , \+ are \] up to the limit . E_S
66268:27	what *T*-1 's amazing is 0 some of them have been on death row for a number of years . E_S
66485:14	you know some people on the case \[ were , \+ were \] a little hesitant on * convicting him on some of the charges E_S
66485:70	you know some people on the case \[ were , \+ were \] a little hesitant on * convicting him on some of the charges E_S
66542:24	there are \[ some , \+ some \] other crimes that I think , uh , you know , uh , N_S
66548:15	but , um , some of these people are just out and out brutal . E_S
66801:49	And \[ \[ some , \+ some \] of the people , \+ uh , some of \] the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too , are picking up some of those great big houses , E_S
66801:91	And \[ \[ some , \+ some \] of the people , \+ uh , some of \] the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too , are picking up some of those great big houses , E_S
67032:120	Uh , so I 've been doing that less , \[ and , \+ and \] concentrating more on , you know , light biking when I get home on the evening *T*-1 and then , you know , some more on the weekends . E_S
67105:22	they want *-1 to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour . E_S
67419:50	and the dog was being house sit *-1 , or dog sit *-1 , whatever , by some friends of mine down the street , E_S
67588:39	Well the puppy jumped \[ in the , \+ into \] some of the pools but not into the , N_S
67788:18	You know for quite some time , just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty . E_S
67910:51	But \[ they , \+ they \] did it because they have a warped mind for some reason . E_S
68296:20	But , if there are some people who *T*-1 do n't agree uh , \[ then there must be , \+ it seems *-2 to be 0 there must be \] at least a reasonable doubt for some people . E_S
68296:115	But , if there are some people who *T*-1 do n't agree uh , \[ then there must be , \+ it seems *-2 to be 0 there must be \] at least a reasonable doubt for some people . E_S
68395:46	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] have , \+ I have \] some friends who *T*-1 do expert \[ wis- , \+ witness \] testimony E_S

69048:36	Oh , \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] some nice things in Baltimore , you know , E_S
69235:82	Well , I guess 0 that 's one of the positive things that *T*-1 \[ ha- , \+ have \] come out of it , some of the employee assistance program . E_S
69317:12	They got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests . E_S
69318:15	They 've MUMBLEx some companies that *T*-1 are doing , uh , hair tests . E_S
69325:53	and they can apparently test , um , back a certain period of time . Because MUMBLEx some of \[ the , \+ the \] residue ends up in your hair follicles , you know , E_S
69394:38	so \[ you ha- , \+ you have \] been to some family reunions , perhaps . E_S
69436:31	and , uh , you know , there 's some my age E_S
69437:19	and then there are some a lot younger , \[ an , \+ \] about four generations , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
69702:22	well at least you 've got some . E_S
69752:23	and , uh , there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way . E_S
69766:19	At least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas . E_S
69843:19	Well , we could use some rain up here . E_S
69930:11	We get some when it 's this rainy *T*-1 , E_S
69961:8	for some reason , because of the cold , uh , ocean , uh , water , the air is always cool . E_S
70000:26	And , they have , of course , some pretty severe storms , Winter storms , snow and that type of thing . E_S
70044:20	Maybe we can send you some . E_S
70254:23	* Living in the city has some advantages . E_S
70312:15	I 've got some onions *ICH*-1 out , tomatoes , E_S
70345:19	Well , I 've done some rewiring on it . E_S
70492:35	And , uh , so , we had *-1 to make some adjustments E_S
70615:79	so . But , um , that 's the hardest part for us is that it 's really , um , you know , budgeting and some extra things , you know , \[ for- , \+ \] that *T*-1 are more , you know , nonessential items . E_S
70687:44	Well , uh , but I do realize that , that is realistic for some people , E_S
70801:79	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know \[ what amount of , \+ what amount of , \] our hardware *T*-1 would stop some fanatic , I guess , from *-2 doing anything , uh , that *T*-3 would be irrational . E_S
70825:88	So \[ tho- , \+ those \] are two areas in which T I stands *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] gain \[ some , \+ some \] short term business 0 *T*-2 to restock that *T*-3 . E_S
70842:55	uh , E_S \[ I kn- , \+ I 'm familiar with \] \[ some , \+ some \] upbeat school areas , E_S
70863:36	* \[ to g- , \+ to give \] you some perspective , \[ this , \+ this \] town that I had lived in *T*-1 for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded *-2 sixty-five per cent by state funds . E_S
70903:134	Uh , \[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ uh , I , \] \+ I do , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 I am \[ a s- , \+ uh , a strong \] and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education . E_S
70928:33	at least what I read *T*-1 , is that some younger people feel that education is priced *-2 \[ out of their , \+ uh , out of their , \] uh , budget . E_S
70962:5	some states they pay , uh , N_S
70963:38	in Germany or \[ in , \+ in \] England in some cases people in my income level , at least , allege that they pay up to \[ six- , \+ fifty-five \] percent of their gross income in taxes . E_S
70968:40	now it costs me money *-2 to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country , some sort of an airport departure tax , uh , uh , \[ a tax , \+ a sales tax \] which *T*-3 is getting to , uh , quite high levels , E_S
70968:68	now it costs me money *-2 to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country , some sort of an airport departure tax , uh , uh , \[ a tax , \+ a sales tax \] which *T*-3 is getting to , uh , quite high levels , E_S
71062:32	and I can still do \[ some , \+ some \] sorts of things E_S
71180:48	in fact , I was going *-1 to go out today *-2 to buy some plants so I could put them in , N_S
71240:27	and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs , , E_S
71562:15	Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling . E_S
71562:27	Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling . E_S
71710:23	I think 0 my wife has some . E_S
71718:14	Or sand even some of them , E_S
71724:14	And there 's some that , like the different colors denotes \[ how much they , \+ how much the tension \] I guess they are *T*-4 and how easy *ICH*-3 they are *T*-1 0 * to move *T*-2 *T*-5 . E_S
71729:8	And some of them are real short E_S
71767:38	\[ \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] \+ some of the \] Nautilus equipment that I started *-1 seeing *T*-2 at the one that we used *-3 to go to *T*-4 was really interesting , E_S
71799:29	Just * to do , you know , some bicep , tricep exercises . E_S
72026:14	and I see some of the problems 0 the kids have *T*-1 when they do n't have a real good family structure *T*-2 . E_S
72059:96	there are a lot of jobs that *T*-1 are coming about , like in computers at home , and those types of things , that *T*-2 would at least in some ways , um , bridge the gap . E_S
72127:44	but we may have *-1 to give up on \[ some , \+ some \] things . E_S
72192:42	I wish 0 I had *?* \[ in , \+ in \] some senses E_S
72201:8	for some reason it seems *-1 to interest me , like people that *T*-2 make a big comeback or , you know , Orel Hershiser , things like that . E_S
72217:16	but they usually have some good articles in it . E_S
72471:15	There may be some schools 0 you could read about *T*-1 and learn . E_S
72672:51	because my sister worked at \[ the , \+ uh , the \] \[ Visa \+ some Bank Americard \] center there . E_S
72758:10	and for some strange reason those people think 0 they need *-1 to get paid *-2 . E_S
72778:11	and then some of them add late fees on it , if they do n't get paid *-1 E_S
72811:70	So , they 've got quite a bit more motivation I think 0 *T*-3 * to get paid *-2 then , some of the others do . E_S
72861:67	I 've got three card offers *ICH*-1 now , uh , from gas companies and , uh , Visa Gold and , uh , some , , other bank , uh , E_S
73129:26	And , uh , when I seen some of my friends that *T*-1 have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else *T*-2 , it 's just , I can imagine how emotional it must be *T*-3 .
73176:40	I think 0 that might be part of the problem with some people . You know , E_S
73395:88	People are being \[ \[ a little more , \+ oh , I do n't know , a little le- , \] \+ a little less \] bigoted in some ways , E_S
73543:7	at some point E_S
73672:17	Well , I got some friends that , uh , N_S
73794:6	some of these are urban worries E_S
73808:17	we 've been having some problem now E_S
73873:46	I think 0 the other thing is that , uh , we have taken some rather drastic turns \[ in our , \+ in our \] education and the way 0 we approach things *T*-1 as of maybe starting back \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm number one , you know , and , uh , uh , uh , * worrying about self and not , uh , seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *T*-2 . E_S
73883:21	if you do n't have some kind \[ of , \+ of \] basic believe or something down inside of you , then it *EXP*-1 's very difficult * to , uh , have anything 0 * to turn to *T*-2 , \[ when you got , \+ when you 've got \] something facing you like that *T*-3 . E_S
73940:12	I see some flickers \[ \[ of , \+ of , \] \+ uh , of \] good directions turning , E_S
73963:9	and , some people just do n't have it . E_S
73981:5	some ways it 's rather frightening , E_S
74180:13	So I have some rather strong opinions . E_S
74203:84	And then I would \[ provide , \+ uh , use \] the money that we 've paying them *T*-1 *-4 to , uh , provide some special help in training and particularly , uh , mentor teachers 0 *T*-2 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who *T*-3 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time . E_S
74211:24	And then * let them try some innovative things and see what *T*-2 works . And then , uh , have some sort of mechanism for * passing that knowledge along to other teachers who *T*-1 could benefit from the same sorts of things . And then from the parents ' side , have the parents support the school . Get involved . E_S

74223:18	That 's , uh , some pretty good ideas . E_S
74251:93	But , uh , \[ that was , \+ that 's \] the extent of which I guess 0 that 's more \[ than , \+ than \] some people , less than others . E_S
74280:27	So we 'd have *-1 to have some way 0 * to , uh , reward and recognize the teachers who *T*-2 are doing a good job and give them \[ a , \+ a \] pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money *T*-3 . E_S
74280:130	So we 'd have *-1 to have some way 0 * to , uh , reward and recognize the teachers who *T*-2 are doing a good job and give them \[ a , \+ a \] pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money *T*-3 . E_S
74294:25	You know , if there 's some gauge that they could make *T*-1 . N_S
74301:8	But some certain type \[ of , \+ of \] position where you 're overseen *-1 *T*-2 * to begin with . E_S
74315:52	at least what I used *-2 to observe *T*-3 in student teaching , was that some college kid who *T*-1 might not be all that bright * to begin with , was thrown *-7 into a class room with a teacher who *T*-4 was harried and overworked and , uh , had too many kids 0 * to handle *T*-5 and too many things 0 * to do *T*-6 and too many interruptions * to pay much attention to the student teacher . E_S
74360:60	Well , another thing 0 I think 0 *T*-1 would be helpful would be * to have some sort \[ of , \+ of \] say a national curriculum . Because one of the problems with * getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for , uh , curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that *T*-2 will sell in Texas and California . E_S
74404:174	And I hope 0 maybe we 're going *-1 to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid *-2 to it with , uh , Reagan 's , uh , new education secretary \[ and , \+ \] uh , you know , \[ trying * to do some , \+ uh , trying *-3 to produce some \] new programs anyway . E_S
74443:58	I measured it one time , because \[ I was , \+ \] uh , we had saw some termites E_S
74598:33	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] seen some wear and tear . You know . E_S
74663:29	I mean we need *-1 to redo some , rewiring ourselves E_S
74843:21	The fire alarm went off for some reason . E_S
74914:42	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] been done for quite some time . E_S
75188:116	It 's kind of scary when I think of what *T*-2 will happen in twenty years , you know , when I have kids and they 're grown *T*-3 and , uh , just kind of some of the changes that *T*-1 will happen even more *T*-4 E_S
75207:8	And some of the other ones were n't born . E_S
75332:25	And since that time everybody 's got some sort of burglar system or , you know , uh , burglar alarms uh , and including \[ the out , \+ uh , the outer \] perimeter type , uh , devices , sensors and things like that . E_S
75584:44	\[ you can , \+ you know , you can \] get some of us , E_S
75795:23	And so , I think 0 some of the things that I did *T*-1 paid off . E_S
75835:19	They , uh , auctioned some tools and , things like that , E_S
75846:57	And , so , well , I thought , gee , I 've been wanting *-1 to , do some brick , uh , walkways for a time . E_S
75858:22	Anyway , it ended up after some pretty , uh , heavy bidding , that I got all those bricks for forty dollars . E_S
75948:31	I do n't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something \[ \[ un- , \+ on , \] \+ on \] top of the sand and then lay the bricks . E_S
75961:15	I did get some material and studied every bit of material that I could study *T*-1 , E_S
76012:37	if they have problems with , uh , sand bugs of some kind I think 0 *T*-3 all 0 they need *T*-1 to do *T*-4 is probably *-2 put some insecticide down in there on \[ a , \+ oh , a \] fairly regular basis , for a while anyway . E_S
76012:96	if they have problems with , uh , sand bugs of some kind I think 0 *T*-3 all 0 they need *T*-1 to do *T*-4 is probably *-2 put some insecticide down in there on \[ a , \+ oh , a \] fairly regular basis , for a while anyway . E_S
76157:23	If , uh , you 've some kid \[ who *T*-2 does n't have , \+ uh , who *T*-1 's \] from a broken family , the schools are supposed *-3 to fill that void . E_S
76252:42	and , uh , there really needs *-1 to be a bridge , some sort of transition for that . E_S
76424:28	I mean , you know , at some point a parent does help their kid , \[ but \+ \] \[ in , \+ in \] some ways , E_S
76424:81	I mean , you know , at some point a parent does help their kid , \[ but \+ \] \[ in , \+ in \] some ways , E_S
76448:61	It *EXP*-3 's amazing how the , you know , people 0 you talk to *T*-1 have some interesting conversations *T*-2 E_S
76676:15	But , uh , some of , N_S
76907:7	And some people said to me , `` Well , that 's our wintertime . '' E_S
76952:28	what do you think 0 *T*-1 are some current trends in , uh , the way 0 families spend time together *T*-2 , based on what you 've seen *T*-3 . E_S
77001:21	and , um , * did some shopping and stuff . E_S
77041:6	some of the people that I work with *T*-1 \[ they , \+ like when I worked on second shift *T*-2 , um , \[ their paren- , \+ their kids \] \] go to school during the day E_S
77104:31	\[ What 's , \+ what are \] some other questions 0 they have *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
77235:16	what *T*-1 are some of the things that you did *T*-2 with your children when they were growing up *T*-3 ? E_S
77401:34	but I think 0 it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours . E_S
77443:88	and \[ you want *-1 to be avail- , \+ at least I 've wanted *-2 to be available , \] when \[ they , \+ for some reason , \[ they had , \+ they were \] \] bouncing something off of me *T*-3 . Because it was something that *T*-4 was bothering them or they were concerned about *T*-4 , E_S
77485:16	every weekend there was some visiting somewhere . E_S
77529:18	And so the kids in some ways \[ \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ are \] suffering a little bit , in that , uh , \[ \[ the model , \+ the role models \] that *T*-2 get \+ \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] family issues that *T*-1 get \] discussed *T*-1 , and all these , I think 0 *T*-3 are very important parts of them growing up , E_S
77548:48	but , uh , \[ i- , \+ it \] seems that there should be some continuity , E_S
77740:20	And you could always find some channel that *T*-1 had something on E_S
77853:41	and I know 0 they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas , E_S
77935:15	they 've had some terrible problems with Hispanics , E_S
78035:34	I 've become very aware of different political views because some of the things 0 we have *-1 to discuss *T*-2 are very politically motivated or whatever , E_S
78207:46	\[ \[ If , \+ if , \] \+ if \] there was some place \[ that , \+ that \] we went to *T*-2 where there was hiking involved * *T*-3 , \[ I , \+ I \] would be you know , happy * to go *-1 hiking , E_S
78230:8	so some of the things are not \[ as , \+ quite as , \] uh , adaptable . E_S
78259:112	I know that , uh , uh , \[ one of , \+ one \] thing that *T*-1 happens \[ to us \+ to \] vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family . E_S
78409:26	but , \[ even , \+ even \] some little ones do pretty good E_S
78638:15	if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and , N_S
78677:35	they have *-1 to kind of take a stand on some things , like abortion and things like that , E_S
79001:12	they had some bends *ICH*-1 , around that we could find and put them in *T*-2 E_S
79097:15	or , is there some reason 0 * not to *?* *T*-1 , E_S
79203:43	\[ I , \+ I 'm \] glad , *-2 to see some of these things , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
79223:32	I 'm that 's about my , uh , some on recycling N_S
79402:37	and he said , um , * let 's give her some race horse shots . E_S
79534:27	\[ I , \+ I \] have some neighbors across the field , E_S
79644:14	I 've got some applications , E_S
79767:78	The other thing about them is too , 0 \[ if you really do n't , \+ you really need \] *-1 to get some and use them because if you have never used them \[ and developed , \+ and have n't developed \] a credit thing . It stops you from *-2 doing a lot of things . E_S
79860:51	and \[ I , \+ when I 'd gotten back *T*-1 I \] had gotten some sun that day , E_S
79920:19	It 's just 0 some of those women that *T*-1 come up there *-2 looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger 's sister just does n't get it . E_S
79941:14	And there 's some days 0 \[ it 's just \+ like it *EXP*-2 's \] the hardest thing in the world * \[ to , \+ to \] get started *-1 *T*-3 . E_S
79971:18	you know , how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle *T*-1 . E_S
80076:41	but when you get into \[ some of these , \+ some of \] health clubs where you just stand around and wait *T*-1 *T*-2 . N_S
80137:5	some people are a little bit fanatical about it . E_S
80268:14	At least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could *?* E_S
80284:13	she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
80319:24	And I 've been *-1 buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways 0 * to paint *T*-2 . E_S
80331:13	and you get some beautiful effects with them . E_S
80516:64	so you really do n't have *-1 to be disrupted for more than about a weekend . If you have some help . E_S
80859:76	I think 0 \[ \[ you have * to let , \+ yo- , \] \+ you got *-1 to segregate \] some of it . E_S
81340:22	I mean , they 're some of the best \[ of , \+ \] that *T*-1 are made *-2 . E_S
81344:38	I think 0 he 's up in a attic , or some part of school . E_S
81357:34	And he 's trying *-1 to save the land from some , ooze . E_S
81438:33	And it 's a brick house , with , uh , some wood . E_S
81474:56	So it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard at that point * to , you know , classify some of the builders . E_S
81521:143	\[ \[ ninety , \+ I would say 0 \[ about , \+ oh , about \] ninety-five \] percent , \+ no I guess 0 \[ may- , \+ probably \] a hundred percent \] of them all are mostly brick , uh , with some wood . E_S
81565:48	\[ An , \+ and \] \[ while , \+ while \] there are some advantages to that , there 's less time spent * outside * making it look nice and taking care of things . E_S
81656:23	Um , we 've actually had some warnings in , uh , Raleigh uh , on air pollution . E_S
81931:14	They were doing some , uh , ozone testing , \[ and , \+ \] uh , \[ th- , \+ the \] E P A E_S
81932:19	and they were just screening some candidates , E_S
82076:39	Well , I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to get some . E_S
82139:73	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] was taking a voice I O class \[ and , \+ um , and \] actually doing some research , E_S
82322:36	but , you know , I know 0 there are some days when \[ she wi- , \+ she wishes \] 0 she was back at work *T*-1 . E_S
82435:13	my wife did some teaching at \[ like , \+ uh , like \] a private tutoring place . A Sylvan Learning Center this year E_S
82690:38	Uh , we 're probably making a comparison against , uh , some European \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , uh , s-s-say , newer republics \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 have very high percentages . E_S
82753:56	but part of the process also is that you must \[ register , \+ preregister \] at some particular point . E_S
82832:83	\[ * to \+ \] \[ if you , \+ if you \] go on the attack , \[ i- , \+ \] and put some sensational thing before the public , as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign , N_S and it is not refuted *-1 , E_S people will , you know , uh , believe it . E_S
82833:49	If you do n't refute it , as he did n't , there must be some truth to the matter , see . E_S
83086:23	Uh , I know 0 in some cases now in some states , depending on the criminal code , uh , a unanimous verdict is not required *-1 . E_S
83086:34	Uh , I know 0 in some cases now in some states , depending on the criminal code , uh , a unanimous verdict is not required *-1 . E_S
83087:10	And indeed some juries are no longer twelve people , E_S
83139:29	Plus , I guess , 0 there was some credit for time 0 this guy had already spent in jail * waiting for trial *T*-1 . E_S
83187:159	But I know 0 you have a right * to ask for a jury \[ in , \+ in \] any sort of a case that even where damages \[ \[ \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ are , \] \+ uh , are \] the result of some sort of \[ a , \+ uh , an \] action that you are bringing *T*-1 against someone else *T*-2 . You can ask for that to be heard *-4 before a jury . E_S
83194:55	* Takes a heck of a long time , I guess , * to get there in some states . E_S
83253:46	\[ so has our , \+ I guess 0 our population has \] grown some too . E_S
83423:17	but there 's just some little difference that , um , *T*-1 causes it not to work an i- , N_S
83609:24	It was starting *-1 to burn some oil . E_S
83631:7	and some people will still buy them , you know , E_S
83762:34	And I just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff . E_S
83765:12	There was some plants that *T*-1 are just Spring bloomers E_S
83797:35	So I just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down . Because I want them to come back up next year . E_S
83827:75	About the only \[ bloom , \+ bulb \] that *T*-1 repeats well in my area is the , uh , uh , daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb . E_S
83830:17	Now I have got some daffodils . E_S
83850:28	The blooms 0 *T*-1 are , on some of them is yellow , purple , white . Just all different colors . E_S
83878:12	It is some type of lily . E_S
83884:16	I have got some in the backyard that *T*-1 bloomed blue . Which I \[ would not , \+ would have \] liked *T*-3 those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better . And then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color . With little purple spots that \[ it , \+ *T*-2 it \] will fade into a solid purple . E_S
83884:123	I have got some in the backyard that *T*-1 bloomed blue . Which I \[ would not , \+ would have \] liked *T*-3 those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better .

83972:12	It is some type of iris though . E_S
84174:22	at New Years , we had some people come in and , uh , like attack one of the planes . Because they were protesting , uh , the presence over in the Persian Gulf . E_S
84277:32	I mean , they are eighteen to twenty-four , some of the young men and women . E_S
84841:36	Likewise , \[ we , \+ uh , we \] do some projects every now and then . E_S
84882:66	so it *EXP*-2 's kind of hard for me to tell what *T*-1 would happen if I lived in some of the valleys inland , E_S
84899:9	interestingly some of the information 0 I 've been reading *T*-1 indicates that the amount of air pollution from , uh , uh , airplanes is extraordinary . E_S
85372:19	Um , E_S there are some areas *ICH*-2 though \[ where , \+ where \] they have a problem with , uh , the houses kind of sinking a little bit \[ into the , \+ to the , \] uh *T*-1 , N_S
85376:69	or the foundation is sinking or something . You know , \[ just a little , \+ just a little \] bit , some more than others . E_S
85529:106	I guess 0 we 're going *-1 to have a lot of parades *ICH*-3 this weekend in honor of these guys \[ that *T*-4 are , \+ that *T*-2 did \] some stuff over in the Gulf .
85613:41	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , , I think 0 some different things *ICH*-2 could come from what *T*-1 's happened *T*-1 , than what we expect *T*-3 . E_S
85736:59	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 we may not have ever have seen that without some of these , uh , newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , soldiers leaving , um , you know , surrendering and , trying *-1 to get out of that situation . E_S
85748:22	you have *-1 to have some compassion some humanness . E_S
85748:27	you have *-1 to have some compassion some humanness . E_S
86064:12	in fact some of the days we froze . E_S
86107:43	The only thing 0 I did n't like *T*-1 was 0 in some of the more touristy areas uh , um , \[ the , \+ it \] would just be besieged *-2 by people wanting * to be your guide E_S
86111:29	and \[ you , \+ \] there were some places , where people , defini- , N_S
86145:23	what we did *T*-1 in some of the other cities E_S and they tell you *-1 to do that is * to hire a local guide E_S
86477:24	but you figure 0 you got some drug guy out there that *T*-1 's got an Uzi machine gun , uh , a thirty-eight , uh , E_S
86732:58	You know , I do n't want *-1 to get out there *-2 deer hunting and have some guy blow me away , E_S
86784:11	there 's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington . Regardless of the racial makeup , E_S
86825:48	You know , \[ the , \+ the \] immediate need * to show some sort of violence *-1 to settle \[ th- , \+ the \] argument . N_S
86828:64	\[ And , \+ and then \] \[ I , \+ I \] am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree , E_S
86846:12	that 's some of the things 0 I think *T*-1 about it , E_S
86852:75	it seems anymore , uh , 0 a movie can not be considered *-1 good unless there 's just \[ some , \+ some \] sort of violence , or something in it . E_S
86896:94	And \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] have *-1 to think \[ that , \+ that \] it has some influence on it . E_S
86913:74	and they were just really coming down on him because of \[ some of the things 0 he was , \+ just some of the things \] that he believed in *T*-1 , some of his morals . E_S
86913:109	and they were just really coming down on him because of \[ some of the things 0 he was , \+ just some of the things \] that he believed in *T*-1 , some of his morals . E_S
87122:21	Uh , she ca n't eat some cream cheese . E_S
87309:16	I guess 0 some of the best things 0 I 've ever had *T*-1 , um , \[ I , \+ \] some of them were just hors d'oeuvres , you know . E_S
87309:72	I guess 0 some of the best things 0 I 've ever had *T*-1 , um , \[ I , \+ \] some of them were just hors d'oeuvres , you know . E_S
87657:24	That would provide , uh , possibly some relief there * to utilize some of the property taxes for other things *T*-2 , see . E_S
87657:43	That would provide , uh , possibly some relief there * to utilize some of the property taxes for other things *T*-2 , see . E_S
87727:7	and some , people do n't even own a car and know how * to drive a car *T*-1 . E_S
88318:25	ours really needs *-1 to have some work done *-2 on it E_S
88330:11	I did some typing for my father when he had the company *T*-1 E_S
88362:23	and also , um , I do some work at U T D E_S
88375:6	some of the commands just had nothing 0 * to do *T*-4 with , you know , \[ what you were supposed *-2 to be doing *T*-3 \+ \[ what they , \+ what they \] did *T*-1 on the \[ com- , \+ computer \] \] E_S
88401:100	and \[ if you add it , \+ if you put a footnote \] \[ in , \+ in \] the middle , you know , if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have *-1 to footnote it , \[ you just change , \+ um , it just automatically changes \] all your footnoting numbers for you . E_S
88429:48	so , um , \[ if you , \+ um , unless you \] have some other things 0 you want *-1 to talk about *T*-2 as * having *-3 to do with P C -s . N_S
88465:44	although , um , I have also done oh , free lance magazine writing and some educational writing . E_S
88467:13	So I did some advertising and P R E_S
88485:17	I 'm anxious *ICH*-1 some day * to have one here . E_S
88724:108	\[ But , \+ uh , so \] when you are first going to school *T*-4 \[ that , \+ \] you kind of have the luxury of *-1 being able *-2 to have some latitude in * choosing the place 0 * to go *T*-3 . E_S
88836:33	\[ I , \+ I \] was involved in some , uh , oh , alumnae recruiting , uh , here in town , uh , recently , uh , well last year . E_S
88894:16	and she was wanting some more information . E_S
88915:15	I think 0 some parents go a little bit overboard . E_S
88964:5	some I do n't . E_S
89007:12	What are some others that you have seen *T*-1 lately *T*-2 ? E_S
89092:13	And there were some others , E_S
89135:65	They say 0 if \[ you really want *-1 to be , \+ uh , you really want \] some suspense , that 's the one 0 * to see *T*-2 . E_S
89235:14	and I enjoy some of the Michael J . Fox movies . E_S
89482:64	See , when you have kids *T*-1 , you like *-2 to be able *-3 to , send them some place where they can yell and you wo n't hear them *T*-4 . E_S
89689:33	and I also feel that that 's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from *T*-1 . Is when people have *-2 to put people in a nursing homes *T*-3 E_S
89695:84	and , uh , they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who *T*-1 \[ had , \+ had , \] uh , apparently inhaled some chicken 0 he was eating *T*-2 . E_S
89707:31	So , I told them 0 he strangled on some chicken E_S
89800:27	but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there E_S
89885:12	he had some accomplices that *T*-1 were kind of suspect , E_S
90501:30	and it was not only in Mississippi , in some other places , as well , E_S
90648:22	I think 0 that 's some of it . E_S
90694:58	but , then again , uh , well , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] have some aunts that , uh , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do *?* *T*-1 . E_S
90771:19	So you probably could give some great advice . E_S
90836:155	\[ \[ I , \+ I think 0 I 'd , \] \+ I 'd \] advise a parent *-1 to send a kid to a school *ICH*-2 , though , that *T*-3 has a number of different types of programs , you know , E_S that , uh , some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer *T*-1 , E_S
90837:49	but some of \[ \[ the , \+ uh , the small , \] \+ some of the larger small \] schools , you know , I guess 0 around three or four thousand students \[ have a , \+ \] can offer a broader range of curriculums and things , E_S
90940:73	\[ yet , \+ like , say , you know , the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something , might have some top specialists in my area . E_S
90987:60	Um , you know , when I first was applying for graduate schools *T*-1 , I applied to some big programs *ICH*-2 , you know , in this area , like Stevens Institute of Technology , which *T*-3 is recognized *-4 in the Northeast \[ as , \+ as , \] you know , one step below M I T in a sense , you know , E_S
91042:34	So you 've really , uh , I guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything . E_S
91300:34	I think 0 it was , um , oh , some actress reading it . E_S
91357:15	I 'm doing some reviews of books , *-2 \[ just to , \+ \] \[ what , \+ \] to sort of recommend \[ to \+ \] \[ wh- , \+ whether \] or not a full-scale review should be done *-1 for the journal , E_S
91411:37	and \[ he really , \+ this man really \] shed some light on , um , some , aspects \[ of \+ of \] Bach 's genius \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and , \] \+ you know , the , \[ and \+ \] more sociological things , you know , like \[ the , \+ the \] idea \[ that , \+ um , that \] \[ music , \+ \] * to be a musician was as much , um , of a family occupation as anything .

E_S
91679:52	\[ Every , \+ every \] family brings \[ a , \+ a \] dish of some kind , E_S
91904:40	And it was , uh , just * to , uh , have some fellowship with her . E_S
91983:14	we stayed at some park E_S
92049:54	I mean , \[ there \+ there 's \] a little bit , because there 's some of those English words that you just do n't exactly know what they mean *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
92186:12	There were some people at the next table who *T*-1 spoke English , E_S
92373:9	Just some of the times they 're continued *-1 , E_S
92491:27	and I guess 0 maybe there are some parts of that , E_S
92509:28	and I like , uh , gymnastics , and some track and field , E_S
92598:48	maybe you saw in the paper this morning that , um , they 've had some problems with , the recycling on plastic , E_S
92857:5	some people \[ are compl- , \+ now are complaining \] because the stuff is n't picked *-1 up at the curbside , you know , E_S
93017:41	Or they will go *-1 dump it out in the middle of some ocean . E_S
93069:93	and then \[ once , \+ about once \] every three or four years I try *-1 to get over to England , because I lived there for a while , some years back . E_S
93357:13	so they took some time off that , uh , they could show us around . E_S
93514:94	so even though I can look at it as a task , \[ the , \+ \] you know , \[ I kind of get the , \+ I get some kind of \] global benefit from the whole thing by *-1 saying , Well , I 'm lowering my chance of heart attack , and \[ thus , \+ that \] type stuff . E_S
93571:57	\[ \[ You , \+ you , \] \+ you \] take the time *-1 to relax some how E_S
93625:24	and I need *-1 to find some place 0 I could go *T*-2 and not feel like there 's all these people who *T*-3 are just huge and hulking that *T*-4 are ... N_S
93723:14	That 'll come some day when I , N_S
93773:15	* must be some Italian spices in there . E_S
93871:32	for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some , um , tomato sauce in it , E_S
94118:46	and we found that if it 's in a certain part of Texas , some people come , E_S
94220:7	and some just come in for Saturday E_S
94225:29	and it 's a chance * to see some of the relatives 0 you do n't see *T*-1 all year long except that once a year . E_S
94285:16	And * choose , some place that everybody 's going *-1 to like *T*-2 as far as food and all that . E_S
94341:15	there have been some really wild shows put * on there . E_S
94375:12	and , uh some people do E_S
94379:7	and some people do n't . E_S
94473:20	but , you know , some that *T*-1 are *?* um , \[ \[ that , \+ they 're , \] \+ they 're \] not quite the same as the kids that *T*-2 are going to the inner city , uh , you know , public schools . E_S
94490:53	\[ It shows , \+ I think 0 it shows \] that the parents have some , uh , desire \[ for , \+ for \] the kid to \[ do , \+ do \] well , you know , E_S
94509:26	and I think 0 this is happening some around the country in terms of , um , morals , * trying *-1 to teach the kinds of things \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 are n't getting taught *-3 at home , \[ \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] \+ and \] respect for other people . E_S
94569:132	and , um , \[ about , \+ I guess 0 about \] \[ when the first , \+ when the youngest \] one was in kindergarten *T*-2 I started *-1 working at a preschool and , uh , you know , doing some work , E_S
94794:154	But when time came *-6 to direct their ability 0 * to make choices to develop the kinds of things \[ that , \+ that \] they 're going *-1 to need *T*-4 *-2 to interact with other people *T*-3 *T*-5 , I felt like I needed some strong influence there . E_S
94939:11	I do some P C stand alone work on it , E_S
94994:24	Um , well , I actually do some work , *-1 working at M I T and at NIST , National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington , E_S
95130:15	She told me some of the things 0 you can do *T*-1 , E_S
95167:11	I do some E_S
95181:14	It 's got some pretty strong competitors . E_S
95230:78	and that gives me the opportunity * to , uh , come in to work and fix it , if I ca n't think of some thing 0 * to tell the trouble shooter *T*-1 while we 're on the phone . E_S
95240:42	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that *T*-1 have happened lately , that I think 0 there are some occupations \[ that they should , \+ \] such as the health field , the transportation field , uh , N_S
95240:102	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that *T*-1 have happened lately , that I think 0 there are some occupations \[ that they should , \+ \] such as the health field , the transportation field , uh , N_S
95246:99	so , \[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] feel like it should be mandatory in some professions , E_S
95399:24	there 's got *-1 to be some backup * to say that N_S
95430:36	but out on the line , they 've got people working some serious equipment . E_S
95440:131	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] just think 0 employers have *-1 to have , \+ * especially given today , the drug abuse that *T*-2 goes on , I just think 0 employers have *-3 to have \] some kind of way 0 * to see that they 're not being put *-7 at risk *T*-6 . Because they 're the ones who *T*-4 are going *-5 to have the lawsuits , the insurance claims , et cetera , E_S
95449:39	\[ and , \+ and \] I 'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims are n't due to , uh , illnesses brought * on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse . E_S
95516:93	\[ And , \+ and then \] they say , well , if you give them the right * to do this , then they 're going *-1 to take some other right away from you , E_S
95595:76	but , uh , \[ I would , \+ I think 0 it would \] be smart if somebody would keep , uh , some sort of a plan that *T*-1 works for them . E_S
95629:47	Well , as a matter of fact , uh , my mother was going through some things *ICH*-2 \[ not lon- , \+ not long \] ago , I guess 0 it has been a couple of years ago , in an old trunk that she had *T*-1 . E_S
95637:49	I mean \[ it was , \+ it was \] just almost laughable in some instances that , you know , N_S
95688:54	Well , uh , we have tried *-1 to , uh , instill \[ some , \+ some \] sense \[ of , \+ uh , of \] budgeting in our kids , E_S
95858:17	and I can take some real great tours to Europe . E_S
96024:12	they have some , but not , not so much . E_S
96028:44	Um , if you go further down , uh , you will usually find some , but not right in there . E_S
96252:12	we have some engineers that *T*-1 still ,
96320:28	So , there are \[ some , \+ some \] strides 0 *T*-1 to be made *-2 there . E_S
96339:138	And , uh , uh , I guess 0 \[ \[ \[ my , \+ I , \] uh , the one , \] \+ my one \] bad thing is \[ that I am , \+ that I wish \] 0 my mother had had some of those opportunities , because , I think 0 \[ she would have really , \+ she rea- , would have \] succeeded in a lot of ways , \[ that men , \+ that women \] were not able *-1 to succeed *T*-2 , in her , generation . E_S
96371:41	So , \[ she is pretty much , \+ although there were some other women in her class , she was , \] you know , uh , one of the minorities ,
96462:35	\[ And so . \+ But \] I know 0 some of the other services do not think that women are capable of *-1 doing the job . E_S
96466:37	\[ they were . \+ I was \] listening to some of the comments on \[ ra- , \+ television *ICH*-1 \] the other day , uh , about it , E_S
96478:43	but I just would rather have , uh , a man *ICH*-1 doing some of these jobs than a woman . E_S
96482:12	There 's some men out there that *T*-1 are more feminine than most women . E_S
96600:105	because , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I placed all but one or two of my calls . And , uh , only because I going *-1 to make some money , E_S
96703:14	It 's , some good , some bad , uh , E_S
96703:21	It 's , some good , some bad , uh , E_S
96826:19	or we really do develop some health problems . E_S
96918:79	\[ I was rea- , \+ I was really \] looking forward to summer , thinking oh , we are going *-1 to have some time off . E_S
97143:12	I have some friends that *T*-1 have children ,
97185:20	well hopefully I can do some consulting work at home . E_S
97278:7	and some were just different objects that *T*-1 \[ have , \+ had \] a definite purpose for kids , you know , E_S
97407:28	And , you know , * maybe do some free lance type work at home . E_S
97460:30	and * \[ have , \+ have \] some kind of real good program , set *-1 up so that \[ you , \+ when you \] go *T*-2 you can be assured that if there 's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid E_S
97464:29	\[ or , \+ and \] * have some kind of program set *-1 up , like you say , * to stimulate the kids , or educate them in some manner .

97552:6	some of the changing roles of women in that respect , I have been a product of *T*-1 . E_S
97812:24	And I think 0 there are some people that *T*-1 have done that , E_S
98498:26	\[ that , \+ those \] are some important points . E_S
98532:93	and , uh , as a say , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-1 to be around , uh , civil cases because I 've been an expert witness some , N_S
98534:37	and one thing that you get *T*-2 if you have some expertise is , uh , you know the range \[ of , \+ of \] possible values or terms or , you know , how heinous was the crime *T*-1 . E_S
98551:5	some people just sit on them once in their lifetime , you know , if they 're that lucky sometimes . Or , you know , \[ what , \+ whatever \] the case may be *T*-1 . \[ And , \+ and \] may not have any idea of \[ what , \+ what \] the standard punishment *ICH*-2 would be *T*-3 for it . E_S
98558:31	And \[ it , \+ they \] may have some different idea , E_S
98723:39	But , you do n't know , uh , I guess at some of the other schools 0 you go to *T*-1 unless you 've been there . E_S
98733:75	And \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] interesting * to notice when you go to different schools *T*-2 that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual , uh , N_S
98735:31	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 some of the dress codes are different at different schools . E_S
98762:52	And one might be a hat day where you have *-1 to come up with some sort of hat *T*-2 . E_S
98802:9	because some of the teachers 0 I know *T*-1 wear , uh , dress up jeans , not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they 've had *T*-2 dry cleaned *-3 so they have got the crease E_S
98813:74	I think 0 the elementary school teachers , or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier \[ than , \+ than \] some of the high school teachers , I think . E_S
98822:24	And you can see 0 in some of the departments in some of the schools , like history at Clark , they 're all pretty fancy . E_S
98822:40	And you can see 0 in some of the departments in some of the schools , like history at Clark , they 're all pretty fancy . E_S
98860:6	some of those male coaches , that might really , N_S
98924:11	Well , some of them , yes they do E_S
98925:33	\[ and , \+ and \] it 's not at some of the private schools , E_S
99116:22	Uh , and so that was some of , N_S
99175:5	some schools I know 0 *T*-1 give , uh , oh , N_S
99204:91	And I 'm , you know , showing them 0 if you 're strong in math and science , kiddos , this is one area where women can make some decent money *T*-1 . You know . E_S
99218:30	Well , it sounds like he 's got some really , you know , good strong ideas of what he wants *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
99306:46	You know , and here it was like , pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime E_S
99396:31	That 's enough * to , uh , do some boating E_S
99480:45	\[ So \+ but , \] uh , you know , we probably did some ice skating on it , E_S
99488:18	Christmas time , uh , some of our relatives would come up from Alabama , E_S
100066:25	Her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in *T*-1 . E_S
100089:8	and some of them , I think 0 *T*-1 unconsciously do it , you know , as a just , you know , half seni- , N_S
100102:51	you know , * go to the dining room \[ and , \+ and \] eat some good meals . E_S
100121:26	Usually there has *-1 to be some wealth involved * , which *T*-2 is great , \[ \[ if , \+ if \] you 're financially , \+ \[ if , \+ if \] you do n't make the decisions so late that you 're worried about money \] E_S
100122:41	but \[ the , \+ the \] places like Presbyterian Village and some of \[ the , \+ the \] retirement places \[ where , \+ where \] they have different levels of care *T*-1 seems *-2 to be so much better , as far as elderly people adapting . E_S
100302:47	and , uh , I had opportunities in high school , * to work in some programs , um E_S
100340:29	Um , but I do know 0 through some organized groups like Scouts and church um , they , do still have opportunities . E_S
100411:91	and \[ maybe , \+ uh , maybe \] this would be a way 0 * to get that feeling back *T*-1 . Um , if we 've lost some of that E_S
100498:28	I 'm glad that there are still some areas \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 get the youth involved *-2 in that sort of thing . E_S
100547:39	But from * talking to people in other districts there are some major problems , uh , with dropouts . E_S
100646:89	And schools now are supposed *-1 to solve social problems , uh , mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try *-2 to provide them with some security . E_S
100771:88	And * let everyone have an opportunity * to reach higher education if they 're willing , you know , *-1 to work and have , uh , some ability . E_S
100975:51	This is something that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff 0 they do *T*-3 . E_S
100990:12	So , in some ways I think 0 *T*-1 \[ the , \+ the \] day schools do serve those purposes . E_S
101092:17	Um , it 's some kind of advisory board *ICH*-2 0 they 've put *T*-1 together for parents and children E_S
101537:103	\[ it , \+ it 's , \] as much as you want *?* , you know torn * up \[ and , \+ and \] rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery E_S
101548:7	and some hard-boiled eggs . E_S
101736:15	I 've had some from Plano , too . E_S
101971:47	I know 0 \[ they do do some , \+ they do have some \] classes *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 in , um , high schools and things for kids 0 *T*-1 to , uh , give them an idea of what family life is like *T*-2 \[ and the , \+ uh , you know , and , uh , that \] kind of thing E_S
102087:22	And I 'm not fond of some of those things E_S
102325:20	I went to dinner with some friends last weekend E_S
102544:8	but some of the different things 0 we 're doing *T*-1 , uh there 's just not \[ a time , \+ enough time \] 0 * to do it all *T*-2 E_S
102638:28	Well , we do \[ s- , \+ some \] dining out . E_S
102740:38	my in-laws also enjoy prime rib , when they 've had some of their specials on Sunday , Monday , or Tuesday night *T*-1 E_S
103023:20	but I know 0 in some areas , \[ \[ \[ it 's really , \+ it , \] \+ it really is \] bad . E_S
103109:5	some people are really afraid * to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid 0 it could become , uh , bomb quality . E_S
103120:13	my line gets some static . E_S
103172:75	It 's just , you know , a possible solution in the future , I think 0 *T*-1 , * maybe to help in some ways . E_S
103192:43	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 with * solving some of the \[ energy , \+ future energy \] problems , we 'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well . E_S
103192:87	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 with * solving some of the \[ energy , \+ future energy \] problems , we 'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well . E_S
103248:15	We 'll have some interesting discussion , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
103332:28	but you know I guess 0 to some people it *EXP*-1 'd almost be better *ICH*-2 * to die to them than * to spend life in prison or whatever
103413:142	, I mean , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not saying 0 \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ capital murder \+ or capital punishment \] is the perfect solution in every case , you know , especially because there are some cases when you just do n't know *T*-1 E_S
103456:48	\[ and , \+ and , \] \[ it really is n't , \+ for some people \[ tha- , \+ \] who *T*-1 have been there for over , and over , and over , it really is n't , \] uh , as bad . E_S
103741:63	\[ Not , \+ not , \] you know , the bouncy , you know * sing along kind but some of the \[ old , \+ older \] ones that N_S
103748:5	some , I do n't even , I recognize \[ the , \+ the \] melodies , and whatnot , E_S
103775:50	it 's kind of haunting , you know , \[ on , \+ on \] some of the notes . E_S
103800:45	\[ does it , \+ does it \] offer , like band , or some of the instruments ? E_S
103886:24	and I could n't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just 0 everybody \[ was , \+ was \] waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were *T*-1 . E_S
104240:43	And \[ there 's some , \+ I think 0 there 's some \] good Disney movies fixing * to come out on video , uh , SHIPWRECKED . E_S
104589:11	I got some good recipes from them sometimes , E_S
104674:70	\[ I \+ , when I \] bought the computer *T*-1 , all of a sudden I was receiving them , for some unknown reason , through the mail . E_S
104752:40	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 there 's just some strange public opinion as to who they want *-1 to give to *T*-4 . Uh , be it through different organizations , March of Dimes type , uh , telethons \[ or , \+ or \] bicycle rides or whatever , how they fund whatever , uh , illness they wish *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
104874:47	\[ I , \+ I \] have a real fear , E_S but that at some point something 's going *-1 to happen . E_S
104882:43	Uh , \[ some people just , \+ uh , I 've heard some people just \] talking in our group of friends that they just feel 0 it 's an invasion of privacy and things like that , E_S
105028:21	but , uh , we did some water skiing *ICH*-1 , of course , \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , * driving around the lake in the boat
105365:54	I think 0 that 's something 0 we might want *T*-1 , too , is some kind of standard transmission *ICH*-2 at least rather than automatic . E_S
105449:34	because I think 0 they may put them into some sort of a program 0 *T*-1 to get them off of drugs . E_S
105526:53	and I think 0 it *EXP*-2 's good that they 're trying *-1 to start some programs down in the elementary schools . E_S
105896:30	I 'd have *-1 to go back through some expense reports . E_S
105900:50	But particularly , down in your area , I 'm looking for \[ some , \+ some \] more restaurants . E_S
106021:28	This is going *-1 to give me some more places 0 * to go *T*-2 . E_S
106068:20	but I think that at some times it can be the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
106196:54	well \[ that 's , \+ yeah , that 's \] right that the children have some responsibility *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too , to their parents and such , * to help * decide what *T*-2 's the right thing . E_S
106250:27	And the second one was 0 I bought some toys \[ at a , \+ um , at a \] craft fair . E_S
106289:67	I had *-1 to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands * to go *-2 buy some paint thinner , \[ and MUMBLEx \+ and \] everything like that , E_S
106322:95	Well , um , so * to speak , I had *-2 to paint \[ this , \+ uh , the \] inside of this warehouse thing that you keep some , um , farm equipment in *T*-1 E_S
106678:13	And then for some reason * taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form , uh , causes you to realize how much *T*-1 is left *-2 . E_S
106889:37	And I think though that we need *-1 to have some liquid *ICH*-3 around that you do n't have *-2 to go through the company *-5 to get *T*-4 . E_S
107099:26	And there are , you know , some places that *T*-1 will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff . E_S
107178:48	I have a friend who *T*-1 just went to , like , Wyoming to some big ranch , you know , where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion *T*-2 . E_S
107341:30	and I think 0 we 'll probably experience some of your weather although I think 0 they have more humidity . E_S
107427:21	I have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing , E_S
107433:47	\[ \[ I , \+ It , \] \+ I \] have worked in some campaigns E_S
107540:43	and I do n't know why we could n't have duplicate voting on some of this *T*-1 . E_S
107811:32	I guess 0 you have *-1 to take some things and leave some things . E_S
107811:42	I guess 0 you have *-1 to take some things and leave some things . E_S
107928:71	but when I do n't need *-1 to dress up for \[ a , \+ a \] meeting or a service of some sort *T*-2 , I do n't . E_S
107978:81	so \[ you do n't have *-1 to , \+ you do n't have *-2 to \] buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do *T*-3 . E_S
108150:96	uh , lot \] of the shows \[ that , \+ that \] I 've liked *T*-1 in the past , like , uh , oh , GOLDEN GIRLS E_S and , some of them tend *-1 to get so risque , E_S
108364:6	some of the punk , um , when I was in high school *T*-1 , that was , uh , one of the big things , was punk music , E_S
108365:80	and , uh , \[ a lot of it \[ is , \+ has \] a lot 0 *-3 to say *T*-2 , \+ or some of it has a lot 0 *-4 to say *T*-1 , \]
108372:78	Uh , well , \[ \[ \[ it , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's , \] \+ it \] really expresses some of the opinions \[ of , \+ of \] the people who *T*-1 enjoy the music E_S
108385:11	Um , some of it , um , E_S
108418:34	and then \[ some of it is , \+ some of it actually gets \] into some serious discussions of problems \[ in our , \+ in urban society . \] E_S
108418:56	and then \[ some of it is , \+ some of it actually gets \] into some serious discussions of problems \[ in our , \+ in urban society . \] E_S
108426:69	I guess 0 I do n't really care *-1 to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times . E_S
108426:87	I guess 0 I do n't really care *-1 to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times . E_S
108435:57	um , I do n't like *-1 to listen to it all the time , but , um , some of the time , anyway . E_S
108439:46	but I do n't really care *-1 to listen to it any more for some reason . E_S
108484:38	you ca n't understand what they 're saying *T*-1 on some of those songs which *T*-2 probably is just as well on some of them , too . E_S
108484:74	you ca n't understand what they 're saying *T*-1 on some of those songs which *T*-2 probably is just as well on some of them , too . E_S
108493:86	but \[ \[ I , \+ I definitely , \] \+ I really \] enjoy the fifties *RNR*-2 , the sixties *RNR*-2 and \[ a lot , \+ some \] of the seventies *RNR*-2 rock and roll E_S
108530:15	Then I have some from like church that *T*-1 are more family recipes that *T*-2 are more useful . You know , budget cookbooks , E_S
108599:70	and it consisted \[ of , \+ of \] grilled kielbasa sausage uh , a potato salad with olive oil , and uh , some tomatoes that *T*-1 had been chopped *-2 up with onions and curry powder
108600:10	and probably some yogurt was in there . E_S
108650:26	\[ We , \+ we \] had some friends over as recently as Saturday night E_S
108669:19	marinated in olive oil and some seasoning , um , and cooked with some olives \[ and some , \+ and some \] prunes , uh , E_S
108669:40	marinated in olive oil and some seasoning , um , and cooked with some olives \[ and some , \+ and some \] prunes , uh , E_S
108669:61	marinated in olive oil and some seasoning , um , and cooked with some olives \[ and some , \+ and some \] prunes , uh , E_S
108835:19	The second thing is 0 some colleges only offer the , uh , liberal arts \[ and , \+ \] uh , whereas like State , they offer engineering courses E_S
108849:8	well some schools may even give you financial aid , where another one wo n't *?* *T*-1 . E_S
108974:18	But I guess 0 some of the other smaller colleges \[ might , \+ might \] be a lot different . E_S
109223:36	so , I guess 0 we 're old timers compared to some people . E_S
109291:52	but the trucks that *T*-1 were supposed * to do it , there 's been some problems with *T*-4 from what I 've read *T*-3 in , you know , the mail that we get *T*-2 E_S
109887:27	I mean I think 0 sometimes some of \[ the , \+ the \] women 's lib though , is kind of like they wanted it all , you know , E_S
109939:36	like just over the weekend I visited my family , and some cousins 0 I had n't seen *T*-1 in a long time , E_S
109964:96	but I 've really noticed that there are \[ a lot of , \+ uh , a lot more \] people that *T*-1 are more comfortable , at least , with some women being home \[ and , \+ \] at least in the circles 0 I 've travelled *T*-2 and in the church that I go to *T*-3 , you know , E_S
109978:29	I found 0 when I did do some work *T*-1 when my son was young *T*-2 , it was like contract work , E_S
110117:58	\[ Ours , \+ um , ours \] barks more \[ than , \+ um , than \] some , because she spent a lot of time at our friends ' house . E_S
110208:21	um , but she might have some contacts here , E_S
110762:96	Um , I think 0 I 'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] deal with *T*-2 in some quality way . E_S
110814:39	What child *T*-1 's going *-2 to say something 0 some parent 's going *-3 to overreact to *T*-4 E_S
110866:79	but * looks to me that it would n't take really that much money * to at least come up with , I mean , some kind of partitions you know , E_S
110956:16	but yet she has some every night . E_S
110989:87	I was just in the shower after *-1 finishing \[ * mowing the lawn and , \+ you know , *-2 mowing the lawn and \] removing some old petunias out of the garden , E_S
111072:41	but we 're still fighting bugs , and ready *-1 to change some of \[ the , \+ the \] summer flowers out E_S
111252:75	and \[ he 's , \+ \[ he , \+ he \] \] must be \[ part , \+ cross part \] with some kind of desert animal , because he 's very long and lanky , E_S
111342:14	and I had some time off in the afternoon , E_S
111366:31	and so that night we had a reception for some of the , uh , potential high school students or college students , E_S
111490:17	Well , what are some of \[ your , \+ your \] favorite inexpensive places *T*-1 ? E_S
111629:100	and , uh , I was thinking about it after I got off the phone , \[ that , \+ that \] I really , you know , wish that there was some way 0 * to , uh , send a message *ICH*-1 to people , you know , about , um , child abuse and things like that *T*-2 E_S
111634:21	those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment . E_S
111642:23	I sometimes have a problem with some of the , especially more famous people who *T*-1 all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork *-2 to say that whatever problems they have *T*-3 , you know , \[ was , \+ was \] because they were \[ abused a- , \+ abused *-4 as \] children . E_S
111709:41	and I was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused *-1 by the man 0 she loved *T*-2 E_S
111740:139	and , uh , you know , \[ there was , \+ there was , \] nothing on it , E_S which *T*-1 makes me wonder , you know , if it 's as , uh , prevalent \[ as , \+ as \] some of them claim . E_S
111873:8	and some of those
111880:10	and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend *-1 to want *-2 to go *-3 eat lasagna and garlic bread . E_S
111992:12	it 's some famous steak place over in Addison . E_S
112067:85	\[ when , \+ when \] I go out *T*-1 , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] normally * to get , um , some specialty type of food E_S
112082:16	and * save you some money too . E_S
112221:74	I would like *-1 to do that *ICH*-2 \[ as a , \+ as a \] family \[ and , \+ and \] some T V watching . E_S
112428:33	I have worked \[ in anoth- , \+ at some other \] ones that *T*-1 were not very good in my opinion . E_S
112573:21	\[ but , \+ but \] some people do n't have a choice . E_S
112860:13	And we had some wonderful , wonderful years there under Roger Staubach . E_S
113041:50	And when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here *T*-1 , of course , they put together some real cute songs , E_S
113059:15	We drive by some houses *ICH*-2 everyday that *T*-1 have big signs , E_S
113375:25	And , uh , * seems like some rather large chunks of money could come \[ from , \+ from \] that direction . E_S
113433:64	If they were *-1 to take half of what they spend *T*-3 on that and put it on some economic , you know , \[ inter- , \+ intergovernmental \] or inter United States like programs that one really might *?* . E_S
113438:36	and I do n't mind , uh , *-2 paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to *T*-1 . E_S
113539:67	Man \[ our cr- , \+ our , uh , prisons are so crowded \] that , uh , they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set *-1 free within a year to two . E_S
113778:21	But \[ some schools , \+ some high schools \] have actually started \[ a program of \+ like a visitation program \] to , uh , you know , \[ areas economically , \+ uh say less advantaged areas . \] E_S
113785:82	And , uh , \[ they , \+ they \] promote service on the part of the kids \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , some of those people . E_S
113792:88	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ we need *-1 to , \+ we need *-2 to \] try *-3 to figure out some way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] turn that around *T*-4 that everybody , N_S
113837:31	Um , uh , I think 0 there 's some problems , E_S
114170:107	uh , E_S because \[ I , \+ I \] need *-1 to have it \[ tuned , \+ you know , tuned *-2 up \] and I do n't know , replace some of the belts . E_S
114192:11	we get some killer winters up here in the mountains . E_S
114926:47	I read , uh , a lot of Steven King , Dean R Koontz , uh some Danielle Steel . E_S
114943:14	I 'll read some , uh , classic , too . E_S
115066:41	\[ I like , \+ I like \] *-1 to read some of the philosophy stuff . E_S
115073:24	and * even like * reading some new age things , things that I do n't quite believe in *T*-1 , E_S
115108:58	And \[ I like *-1 to read , uh , \+ I like *-2 to read \] some self help books like , uh , E_S
115326:26	\[ I , \+ I \] do some things . E_S
115503:40	But , uh , there 's , uh , \[ some , \+ some \] stuff that I want *-1 to do *T*-2 with like Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or something like that . E_S
115627:14	I 've sailed some . E_S
115783:37	Uh , there are supposed *-1 to be , uh , some people \[ f- , \+ moving down here from \] Colorado Springs for T I . E_S
115838:37	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 there are some areas \[ where we , \+ where we , \] uh , pretty well , you know , get our money 's worth *T*-1 , E_S
115896:27	Uh , there has *-1 to be some way , I think , 0 * to equalize education opportunities *T*-2 . E_S
116080:22	in fact , I just got some reservations . E_S
116167:16	But we 've had some pretty nice weather . E_S
116302:12	I know some people that *T*-1 went to B Y U . E_S
116525:97	Well , maybe this thing \[ with \+ , with \] the child at school , maybe that will make people think a bit more and , you know , take some steps *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] correct it . E_S
116914:25	it ended up 0 I got some furniture *ICH*-2 back that one of them had moved *T*-1 out or something . E_S
116938:64	I just still have need for the four bedrooms *-1 just having company from time to time . And some of them coming back home and things , you know . E_S
117155:50	\[ \[ Is , \+ Is \] this , \+ is this \] one with some company \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 services you and takes your calls and all that stuff ? E_S
117393:34	And , uh , *-1 seeing as you 've got some older children , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] wondering , how did you handle that *T*-2 , when they were growing up *T*-3 ? E_S
117423:28	or uh , you know , you got some cartoons E_S
117893:85	\[ that 's , \+ \] \[ y- , \+ \] * count your blessings because uh , it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves *T*-1 . E_S
118191:29	so you ought *-2 to be saving up some every month *-3 to make up for all what they should be taking *T*-1 out . E_S
118317:79	And , um , I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more , that maybe that could solve some of our problems . E_S
118337:14	I think in some ways that *T*-1 they need *-2 to be more careful of the teachers that they hire *T*-3 . E_S
118353:34	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] heard some \[ horrible , \+ horrible \] stories about \[ high , \+ high \] school teachers E_S
118538:18	\[ These , \+ some of these \] young kids 0 you read about *T*-1 , * *EXP*-2 just does n't bother them * to kill someone at all E_S
118587:14	I was watching some show the other day , E_S
118637:8	and some boy 0 she tried *-1 to get rid *-2 of *T*-3 , he was like in his twenties , N_S
118682:69	and , uh , the police are not going *-1 to do anything until \[ they , \+ they 've \] committed some sort of a crime . E_S
118693:79	Uh , I just have a feeling that we 've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know . E_S
118726:65	and uh , , you know , of course \[ I , \+ I 'm \] sure 0 we have some enemies down there who *T*-1 would n't care what *T*-2 happened to us , E_S
118743:72	and , uh , \[ we , \+ we \] dabble in it just enough *-1 to make both sides angry at us some how , some times , E_S
118743:80	and , uh , \[ we , \+ we \] dabble in it just enough *-1 to make both sides angry at us some how , some times , E_S
118960:11	but maybe some day they can get closer , E_S
119425:11	We bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas , E_S
119528:95	and I think 0 that certainly makes a difference \[ from , \+ back from \] the time when somebody handcrafted something *T*-1 and , you know , had some pride in it *T*-1 . E_S
119578:59	But I 'm ready *-1 to have a President *ICH*-3 elected *-2 that *T*-4 at least has some sort of a domestic agenda , E_S
119756:19	Um uh , well , some of both . E_S
119833:16	I 've read some things about him that \[ he was , \+ he was n't \] too good himself . E_S
120034:21	and they had , uh , some names , some companies that *T*-1 sold mustang parts , E_S
120034:29	and they had , uh , some names , some companies that *T*-1 sold mustang parts , E_S
120035:23	and I just started *-1 ordering some parts E_S
120096:10	or do some of them play the same song ? E_S
120176:12	and , maybe some day . E_S
120325:14	something giving you some affection as well . E_S
120426:19	Um , * tell me some about your camping experiences , Carolyn . E_S
120451:47	and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning , E_S
120500:62	but by then , of course , I was able *-1 to \[ catch , \+ uh , catch \] some things , E_S
120601:39	Saint Augustine , uh with a little Bermuda mixed * in in some of the sunny areas E_S
120719:7	and some people call them May beetles . E_S
120726:23	They said that every yard has some E_S
120734:17	well , I had some of that problem , E_S
120913:59	But , uh , \[ somebody , \+ somebody \] was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we 're paying *T*-1 , it 's not that we mind *-2 paying taxes , it 's that we 're paying too much for a lousy government . E_S
121055:50	I was even planning *-1 to go out and to , uh , dig up some hibiscus plants that *T*-2 will not make it through the winter here , but , you know , were planted *-3 in the ground since last spring E_S
121059:47	and I was going *-1 to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me , E_S
121135:48	So , uh , I guess as long as you can have , uh , some grass there . E_S
121309:28	I just wish 0 they 'd bring some of the old characters back . E_S
121349:21	Now she 's married to some guy in New York , E_S
121496:88	If I was having a dinner party I would probably , um , have \[ \[ some , \+ um , some , \] \+ uh , um , some \] fruit 0 * to start with *T*-1 with some apples sliced * up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and , um , probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some , uh , uh , salsa and chips *ICH*-2 around and peanuts .

121514:51	Um , maybe some rolls and , um , I guess *T*-1 some , uh , some rice or something like that . E_S
121522:14	that would take some planning E_S
121532:58	You know , \[ I want * to , \+ I want *-1 to \] throw some charcoal on the grill \[ and , \+ and \] throw a steak *ICH*-2 on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that E_S
121532:109	You know , \[ I want * to , \+ I want *-1 to \] throw some charcoal on the grill \[ and , \+ and \] throw a steak *ICH*-2 on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that E_S
121681:11	They have some delicious , delicious things , E_S
121695:100	and you take , um , \[ s- , \+ \] little bit , maybe two tablespoons of butter \[ and a fr- , \+ \] in a big frying pan . And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt , E_S
122158:32	Uh , \[ what , \+ what \] are some of the shows that you have been able *-1 to rent *T*-2 *T*-3 though ? E_S
122424:29	\[ We , \+ we 've \] talked some about it in my state because we 've had a lot of , uh , prob- , N_S
122445:40	Where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses *T*-1 E_S
122530:23	Well , if you play with some consistency though , you can get it right back down . E_S
122634:12	That 's some cold golf too , is n't it *?* ? E_S
122775:19	I know 0 maybe some of the big things that , uh , uh , N_S
122831:46	I think , uh , 0 it *EXP*-3 's in everyone 's nature to some degree * to want *-1 to get out and explore something 0 they have n't *?* *T*-2 , or experience something , you know , indifferent . E_S
122843:15	There must be some \[ better so- , \+ better \] way of * doing this . E_S
123159:9	and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire . E_S
123329:13	and there 's some other city . E_S
123345:26	I 'd like *-1 to see some more teams get in . E_S
123453:40	we 're supposed *-1 to have a chance * to get some rain the next couple of days here , uh , which *T*-2 will be , you know , a little bit more typical , uh , autumn weather .
123500:35	So \[ you , \+ you \] all actually had some color , huh ? E_S
123536:42	\[ I was up , \+ I was up \] there cutting some firewood this weekend , E_S
123551:32	Uh , \[ it , \+ there 's \] some trees N_S \[ like the oaks , \+
123654:51	I do n't know who *T*-1 played when and who *T*-2 does what like some guys are *?* . E_S
123810:25	and maybe we 'll meet up again some time . E_S
124121:35	but now \[ I , \+ I \] do like some of these , uh , brighter , fluorescent colors . E_S
124152:9	maybe some day
124235:48	my son E_S and I used *-1 to have a bet *ICH*-3 going about some of the players that *T*-2 had moved from here to Minnesota , E_S
124387:72	\[ It 's hurting , \+ you know , it 's hurting \] Germany *ICH*-1 , for example , too , and some other parts of Europe \[ where they , \+ where they \] have high industry *T*-2 . E_S
124494:29	That might help a little bit , especially in some places . E_S
124521:56	I really think , uh , you know , 0 we 're doing \[ some , \+ some \] important things . E_S
124794:18	and then , um , some other credit cards , like store credit cards , you know , I do have them up there a little bit , E_S
124874:31	so that I use *T*-1 , because I travel some . E_S
125339:17	I 've just received some . E_S
125380:11	Um , some of the qualifications that I look for *T*-1 was \[ that , \+ \] uh , you know , the cost , and , um , exactly what they did *T*-2 , if it was structured or nonstructured , if they had a little academic , um , uh , in there , and , um , you know , um , you know , what the qualifications of the teachers ' were *T*-3 , and if the place was clean and um , the hours E_S
125518:87	\[ \[ \[ Some , \+ some places , um , start them as early as , I think , \] \+ well , some , \] \+ some places \] take them as infants , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , like eight weeks , even . E_S
125523:79	a friend of mine who *T*-1 's a nurse \[ is , \+ was \] telling about a wonderful new place that *T*-2 opened some place \[ in , \+ on \] Fifteenth Street , E_S
125531:15	you know , some places just specialize in just real little ones E_S
125585:7	and some days he does n't , E_S
125616:45	I think 0 you feel better , too , if you get on some program like that , E_S
125631:19	but um , there are some parts during that exercise that I think , I can not do another second of this *T*-1 . E_S
125636:58	I know 0 \[ \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it , \] \+ some of it \] is so tough E_S
125819:79	\[ Next , \+ next \] car 0 I get *T*-1 's going *-2 to be a four door *ICH*-3 too . Something with some room . E_S
125891:58	I 've got where now I can hit it \[ in , \+ in \] the air some of the time *T*-1 . E_S
125907:106	Well , \[ that \+ \] \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 that 's what I need *-1 to do *T*-2 \[ is , \+ is \] * get some kind of lessons or something . E_S
126073:18	I guess 0 in some cases they just consider *-1 pickup \[ your , \+ your \] phone \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not . E_S
126077:43	Um , but I thought 0 I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using E_S
126086:11	Uh , some of MUMBLEx did too . E_S
126180:11	Uh , some of that unfortunately is legal . E_S
126185:29	but is it a legal , uh , solution for some companies . E_S
126329:17	\[ som- , \+ some \] kids are so spoiled nowadays E_S
126335:16	and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes E_S
126357:64	Sometimes I wish 0 we 'd help them out instead of *-1 going all across the world , and helping some countries 0 I never even heard of *T*-2 . E_S
126487:26	\[ E- , \+ even \] in some families some people talk a little bit different . E_S
126487:31	\[ E- , \+ even \] in some families some people talk a little bit different . E_S
126736:18	I can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students 0 I see *T*-1 over at the medical school . E_S
126822:34	but , probably once a month or so , there was some reason that I would have *-1 to put on a suit *T*-2 . For a customer presentation or something . E_S
126893:8	and some of these mini skirts , you know , are worse than shorts ever thought about *-1 being *?* . E_S
127074:72	\[ \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] heard 0 they 're , \+ I hear 0 you have \] some problems . E_S
127180:32	Oh , \[ I , \+ I \] know some of the people . E_S
127319:33	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] done some water exercises , E_S
127331:34	You do n't go out when it 's twenty some odd degrees *T*-1 , go out to the swimming pool . E_S
127487:16	not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into *T*-1 . E_S
127632:40	so \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know some of those shows now , like I used *-1 to *?* . E_S
127759:25	I mean , they 'll have some things *ICH*-1 in there \[ that *T*-2 almost , \+ almost , \] you know , like supernatural , or something , E_S you know ,
127907:10	occasionally , some ice skating will come on , on a Sunday or during the Olympics E_S
128082:18	But if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning , just like * brushing your teeth you 're going *-1 to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour .
128203:27	and then you go *-1 to read some order book or something E_S
128211:32	Uh , I suppose 0 \[ things , \+ some things \] well happen slowly simply by * having it taught *-1 in the schools more to the extent that that 's happening , * having a new generation *ICH*-3 come up that *T*-2 's more used to it . E_S
128271:12	they have some of those in Ohio . E_S
128574:17	But , did they have some pretty good special effects ? E_S
128653:11	They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION . E_S
128741:28	what do you feel 0 *T*-1 are some of the main problems ? E_S
129152:27	I 'm going *-1 to look into some other fields . E_S
129591:19	So , we might have some cocktails *ICH*-1 ahead of time and maybe \[ some , \+ uh , some \] dip , uh , some cheese . E_S
129591:60	So , we might have some cocktails *ICH*-1 ahead of time and maybe \[ some , \+ uh , some \] dip , uh , some cheese . E_S
129591:75	So , we might have some cocktails *ICH*-1 ahead of time and maybe \[ some , \+ uh , some \] dip , uh , some cheese . E_S
129592:38	One of our favorites is , uh , * to take some , * let 's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think , is that what *T*-1 comes in those little blocks ? And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and , uh , wash them and cool them and then dump them in the , uh , sauce and then take crackers E_S
129714:43	\[ and , \+ uh , so \] we 've done that for quite some time , E_S
129744:37	Although \[ just , \+ just \] about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that , uh , *T*-1 work in the library for me said 0 they had n't gotten theirs . E_S
129782:55	I do news , mostly newspapers and , uh , plastic two liter diet Coke bottles . And aluminum cans some , E_S
129820:27	Well , I guess 0 there are some places , uh , in the north , in particular that , uh , *T*-1 have a real definite way of * encouraging you to recycle E_S
129842:12	what are some of the things 0 they do n't recycle *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
130539:29	and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and , uh , hung out with them , worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp . E_S
130609:46	Uh , the closest thing 0 I did *T*-1 was * go to some like , uh , restored castles and stuff . E_S
130613:26	\[ That , \+ there \] is some on that west coast of France E_S
130779:110	\[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 really works , uh , at least down here is , \[ if there is , \+ if there is \] \[ some , e- , \+ even some \] money 0 * basically to take care of the gas 0 * to recycle it *T*-4 *T*-5 , you know what I mean *T*-2 , then people tend *-3 to do it .
130800:49	\[ And , \+ uh , so , \] you know , if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings , anything that they can pass *T*-1 on to the consumer , you know ,
130800:69	\[ And , \+ uh , so , \] you know , if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings , anything that they can pass *T*-1 on to the consumer , you know ,
130831:73	And one way that we do it sort of \[ in , \+ in \] Iowa *T*-1 is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops . E_S
130945:16	Well , we have some very nice \[ hou- , \+ homes \] here in this area . E_S
130983:8	but some of those are pretty big . E_S
131019:41	and , I guess 0 \[ he , \+ he \] did some crazy thing *-1 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away , type of deal . E_S
131019:58	and , I guess 0 \[ he , \+ he \] did some crazy thing *-1 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away , type of deal . E_S
131026:14	And , so , some were vacant for quite a while before \[ they , \+ you know , they \] finally sold them because there were so many . E_S
131113:19	Well , we do to some degree E_S
131302:38	so , uh , it *EXP*-1 would be kind of exciting in some ways * \[ to , \+ to \] see a little bit more of that E_S
131303:7	and some ways , it might be kind of scary . E_S
131544:12	Especially in some of these schools around here , I think 0 they have about twenty percent older students . E_S
131550:15	I 've seen some people that *T*-1 are really quite up there you know
131658:35	* Are going *-1 to have *-2 to solve some of the problem , huh . E_S
131749:37	I probably need *-1 to take \[ some , \+ some \] more lessons , uh , more current \[ and , \+ uh , and \] practice more often . E_S
132170:17	and there 's probably some truth to that . E_S
132413:27	like , * try *-1 to get some place and exercise from five to six , E_S
132424:22	Well , I know , 0 some people go during lunch , E_S
132476:19	It beats memberships at some of these clubs . E_S
132716:168	and then you just dip the carcass in , uh , boiling water , pull it out , and \[ there 's a , \+ we use a \] little raspy brush , 0 *T*-1 pulls the hair off , and , uh , gut it , and , uh , just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and , uh , some pineapple , about three pineapples , you know , * sliced them up , and , uh , cover him up with , uh , wet , uh , sacks , feed sacks is what I usually use *T*-2 and then start a charcoal fire on top of him .

E_S
132952:6	some of the cars that I got *T*-1 were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors E_S
132952:58	some of the cars that I got *T*-1 were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors E_S
133032:24	Um , and it really saved us some big money once . E_S
133248:14	I certainly have some ideas since I 'm studying it now in college . E_S
133378:41	But I do think that we have *-1 to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five , six grades and just keep *-2 going over and over and over until most of those that *T*-3 are capable can at least learn *-4 to read and write E_S
133508:12	What are some of the other questions *T*-1 . E_S
133683:50	Well , it went pretty well , uh , other than the fact that we encountered some , uh , problems that you run across *T*-1 in older homes with plumbing , which one thing led to another *T*-2 , E_S
134185:52	and I think that \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] very surprising 0 some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten *-1 for a lot less money than you would think if you 're willing *-2 to buy ones that *T*-3 are about , the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own *T*-4 E_S
134199:14	Well , certainly some of the top end ones . E_S
134266:50	Uh , the State of Wisconsin , as a matter of fact , uh , started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution 0 we were getting *T*-1 . E_S
134334:65	maybe to you and I who *T*-1 have grown up \[ in some \+ in , uh , uh , some \] more beautiful parts of the country , uh , I think \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , we become a little more aware *ICH*-2 , uh , rather quickly \[ of , \+ of \] what *T*-3 's happening with air pollution and \[ how , \+ uh , how \] horrible it really is *T*-4 . E_S
134341:41	and we 'll let them try *-1 to drink out of some of the lakes and try *-1 to fish in some of the lakes that *T*-2 have been suffering from , uh , the , uh , acid rain E_S
134341:71	and we 'll let them try *-1 to drink out of some of the lakes and try *-1 to fish in some of the lakes that *T*-2 have been suffering from , uh , the , uh , acid rain E_S
134364:43	I think 0 it 's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry \[ of , \+ of \] the Gary area E_S
134392:136	but , I , um , tend to all the , planting the annuals \[ and , \+ and \] the spraying and , um , *-1 taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in , you know , throughout that season , and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and , um , any kind of decorating for the holidays , you know , E_S
134464:48	\[ I think , \+ um , I was thinking \] about *-1 throwing some \[ for , \+ in \] the back , \[ just where the kids , um , \+ \] just way in the back , behind the swing sets E_S
134465:17	or , just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty . E_S
134584:15	we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders . E_S
134584:24	we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders . E_S
134590:24	and , uh , we 've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries . E_S
134590:33	and , uh , we 've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries . E_S
134590:42	and , uh , we 've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries . E_S
134590:49	and , uh , we 've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries . E_S
134612:30	of course you 're going *-1 to lose some that way E_S
134642:45	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] worked on some of it at T I once upon a time . E_S
134858:11	* Kiss some butt , E_S
135180:26	Um , I try *-1 to do some painting , although I 'm not very good at it . E_S
135200:26	\[ I , \+ I \] do some sewing , mostly out of necessity . E_S
135546:36	To me , half the time it 's more fascinating than some of these made up stories . E_S
135578:12	it was some time ago . E_S
135618:37	I know , uh , 0 \[ the Bri- , \+ some of the British \] people laugh at us because we 're so enthralled with their royalty . E_S
135700:26	And then * make movies out of some of them . E_S
135716:32	so she could n't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers , E_S
136240:21	I think 0 he has some interesting things on it . E_S
136256:12	there 's some real weird people that , he seems *-1 to come up with *T*-2 . E_S
136266:15	He does have some real bizarre things , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
136311:25	I mean , we still have some highways closed *-1 , E_S
136324:26	and I saw , 0 there were some stop signs , I mean , submerged * up to the writing on the stop sign , E_S
136336:16	So there has been some flooding E_S
136422:44	We 've been getting quite a bit , maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio , E_S
136514:16	or you been doing some remodeling work on it . E_S
136527:86	Thing is , N_S 0 \[ we 've , \+ uh , the main thing that we 've \] had *T*-1 with this house recently has been some , uh , squirming , I call it * , of the foundation . E_S
136670:15	I mean , some nights it 's just \[ real , \+ real \] quiet . E_S
137117:28	it 's been because of the size or some problem like that . E_S
137447:75	Do they still have \[ the , \+ uh , the \] scenic , uh , roadways that *T*-1 cut through the center of some of those trees ? E_S
137751:17	But they 're doing some stomping on Virginia . E_S
137888:11	Uh , some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north . The C D and the premium sound system . E_S
137927:6	some of these muddy driveways could use it around here . E_S
137940:16	well , you had some there . E_S
138173:59	I think 0 we need *-1 to get back to \[ the , \+ \] * show some respect E_S
138249:36	so I think that maybe that 's effected it to some degree . E_S
138279:11	* put some shelves in
138280:21	\[ and , \+ and \] some odd stuff around the house E_S
138292:57	Uh , a few years ago , uh , \[ we needed , \+ uh , they needed \] some book shelves E_S
138293:21	and I kind of drew up some simple plans * to make some book shelves E_S
138293:38	and I kind of drew up some simple plans * to make some book shelves E_S
138313:30	and , uh , * sounds like you got some real nice tools , too . E_S
138314:39	Do you think 0 you would be able *-1 to do some more if you had more tools and different tools ? E_S
138431:104	\[ I 'd , \+ I 'd \] kind of like *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] look at equipment like a lathe or like you say , a table saw and some of those things that *T*-2 would make , uh , some pretty nice , uh , pieces of , uh , well , wood , \[ for , \+ for \] different things for tables , \[ for , \+ for , \] uh , chairs , for , you know , decks and so forth E_S
138431:138	\[ I 'd , \+ I 'd \] kind of like *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] look at equipment like a lathe or like you say , a table saw and some of those things that *T*-2 would make , uh , some pretty nice , uh , pieces of , uh , well , wood , \[ for , \+ for \] different things for tables , \[ for , \+ for , \] uh , chairs , for , you know , decks and so forth E_S
138438:36	It 's an opportunity * to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel *T*-1 day to day E_S
138479:32	I mean I 'm sure 0 there 's some good ones , E_S
138488:37	But \[ I kind of , \+ I \] liked it some ways E_S
138489:7	and some ways I did n't . E_S
138608:72	\[ then , \+ then \] on the other hand I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's harder * to stay home in some regards . E_S
138683:22	you have *-1 to have some form of health insurance . E_S
138852:74	uh , I do n't remember what they call it *T*-1 , sort of like a positive , negatives or \[ some , \+ some \] kind of word 0 they use *T*-2 when \[ a , \+ \] uh , you get \[ a , \+ uh , a \] positive indication of drugs *T*-3 , E_S but \[ there 's not really , \+ there were n't really \] any there *T*-3 . E_S
139013:67	* seems to me 0 I remember that , uh , I was hired *-1 , came in and went through some orientation E_S
139069:41	So here , I know that , uh , last year there was some ice storms while I was out of the state E_S
139083:29	You may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like 0 we 've been getting *T*-1 in December , E_S
139376:60	Uh , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] did n't realize that we 'd signed some type of deal like that . E_S
139796:37	My folks and I always had a dog and a cat , some , birds , E_S
139825:17	We 've got , some children who *T*-1 would just really , uh , enjoy *-2 having an animal , you know , a dog , I think 0 *T*-3 E_S
139872:14	we 've got some children E_S
139882:25	You sound like you 've got some small ones in the background . E_S
140022:20	Well , you 've got some experience behind you in the work force . E_S
140194:15	but my son needed some money , E_S
140339:20	uh , and then what some people would consider *T*-1 a little more difficult , \[ I , \+ I 'll \] change spark plugs E_S
140559:38	Um , well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in *T*-1 , E_S
140959:72	You know , maybe \[ you nee- , \+ you can get \] it signed *-1 up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes . E_S
140962:42	Well , \[ we 've heard bad , \+ we 've heard some bad \] things about some of those , you know , E_S
140962:56	Well , \[ we 've heard bad , \+ we 've heard some bad \] things about some of those , you know , E_S
141065:17	and I 'll take some time and do that with her . E_S
141108:13	and * spend some time with him . E_S
141148:33	and then they 'll get *-3 to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get *-1 to pick *T*-2 out E_S
141331:7	and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat . E_S
141431:40	There is one cousin out in Colorado , uh , uh , some cousins over in Phoenix , uh , E_S
142030:25	You know , I mean , some topics , N_S
142052:37	well , it seems like , I do n't know , some things are sensationalized *-1
142053:7	or some things are , um , E_S you know ,
142064:55	And , uh , I also like *-1 to plant flowers and \[ do \+ do \] some gardening and do arts and crafts . E_S
142227:39	\[ some , \+ uh , you know , I have some \] good shots and some bad shots . E_S
142227:51	\[ some , \+ uh , you know , I have some \] good shots and some bad shots . E_S
142261:71	and I even had , uh , I guess 0 it was *RNR*-1 last year or the year before , I had some out E_S
142285:15	I have got some of those too , E_S
142291:42	And \[ I do , \+ I try *-1 to do \] some arts and crafts E_S
142303:50	\[ I , \+ uh like you , I \] have n't done any in quite some time except for what I call *T*-1 living now \[ which *T*-2 is , \+ which *T*-3 is \] very close to * camping . E_S
142418:201	But , uh , you know , right now , uh , what we did *T*-1 , my wife and I , is 0 we got a mobile home . One of these twelve by forty-eight 's that *T*-2 got repoed *-3 , And , uh , swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring 0 I would build a house some day , you know . E_S
142642:12	There are some columns that *T*-1 could be painted *-2 *-3 a different color too . E_S
142923:84	As far as the Rangers are concerned *-1 , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 they \[ need some , \+ definitely need some \] pitching . E_S
142973:83	and I think 0 you 're probably right , \[ that they , \+ that they \] need \[ some , \+ you know , some \] changes in , uh , pitching coach , maybe E_S
142994:34	They need *-1 to have \[ some , \+ some \] young guys that *T*-2 can take the lead E_S
143109:20	actually now you can get some really good deals *-1 flying over , E_S
143137:40	You know , I 'd like *-1 to go to Hawaii some time , E_S
143198:38	Well , you 'll just have *-1 to plan a vacation some time \[ and , \+ and \] go over there . E_S
143327:28	It sounds like we 've been to some of the same places . E_S
143645:21	And there are , uh , some fairly sophisticated approaches that *T*-1 are used *-2 in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people , uh , gain a competence with respect to the material . E_S
143680:38	you must see kids with real significant problems , uh , in some cases . E_S
143814:17	But I know 0 some people can \[ get , \+ get , \] you know , carried *-1 away with them and let them get out of hand . E_S
143835:16	It seems that some of them have gotten higher E_S
143841:50	I do n't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or \[ some , \+ some \] other state 0 *T*-1 had a Visa card that *T*-2 was the lowest one in the country . E_S
143936:15	I 've got some that \[ I , \+ you know , I \] have n't even used *T*-1 at all , uh , past few years E_S
144096:32	Well , \[ th- , \+ there \] were some people \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 had a problem with that . Because they found out later on that , jeez , you know , a guy will lie rather than get killed *-2 . E_S
144544:40	But , uh , uh , I know that , uh , in some of these larger cities they 're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing \[ * to prevent , \+ \] you know , so that , uh , the drug addicts wo n't be getting dirty needles and everything . E_S
144705:86	a lot of \[ the , \+ my \] family , you know , they fear me working like that and , under \[ some , \+ some \] of those conditions , E_S
145004:14	And you hear some people say , you know , N_S well , he 's a man , E_S
145350:46	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] know pe- , \+ I know some other people \] that *T*-1 have done that . E_S
145353:19	uh , I got in some \[ problems with , \+ uh , financial problems because of \] credit cards E_S
145367:62	\[ \[ I h- , \+ I have , \] \+ we have \] \[ some , \+ some \] friends that *T*-1 did \[ the , \+ exactly the \] same thing . E_S
145433:60	even with my gas card you know , I find that I 'll go in *-1 to get some gas E_S
145456:31	I mean , there are \[ sort \+ some \] inherent limits there , E_S
145538:67	\[ I , \+ in fact , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] \] even , uh , heard some people that *T*-1 have applied for credit cards with much less , uh rates and have paid off their , you know higher interest rate , uh cards and just sent them back , you know . E_S
145554:69	And \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 \[ there 's some , \+ there 's , uh , uh , some \] negotiating there , too , E_S
145693:13	and they took some rooms down at a Holiday Inn E_S
145694:20	and , uh , they had some activity , E_S
145725:35	Uh , I found \[ out some , \+ about some \] of the relatives
145726:75	\[ \[ I did n't , \+ you know , I , \] \+ I \] did n't even know their names , some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles E_S
145726:101	\[ \[ I did n't , \+ you know , I , \] \+ I \] did n't even know their names , some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles E_S
145920:28	because I looked into *-1 picking up some , uh , medical insurance \[ for my , \+ just for my \] family , you know , \[ just , \+ \] N_S
145948:130	I guess 0 \[ what , \+ \] the other benefits \[ \[ that , \+ uh , that I , \] \+ uh , that I \] miss *T*-1 , I guess is , uh , you know , some of the bonuses and stuff \[ that \+ that \] *T*-2 goes on with just * being involved *-3 with a big company , you know E_S
146094:19	Um , I 've done some cross stitching . E_S
146202:136	Well , one thing that I like *T*-1 about this fabric painting thing is 0 I can just make a T shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then , um , cut out a little pattern *ICH*-2 \[ from the material , \+ from some material , \] like flowers or something , and make , um , a design or , you know , a little arrangement or something on the shirt and , you know , fuse it on with Heat and Bond , or whatever and then paint around it . E_S
146229:41	So \[ I had , \+ I went \] and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back E_S
146546:25	I do think that there are some significant kinds of things 0 * to to look for *T*-4 *ICH*-1 , you know , if you are faced *-2 with * placing someone . In a place like that , uh , you know , aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that *T*-3 is offered *-5 and such E_S
146578:18	\[ some , \+ some \] of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] people that *T*-1 are in there are \[ real , \+ you know , very \] nice and friendly to everybody E_S
146596:83	I think 0 it would matter too , uh , kinds of , uh , disabilities that the nursing home accepts *T*-1 . Because there are some , uh , who *T*-2 poor things , you know , do n't have , uh , any real grasp on reality any longer . E_S
146614:76	Well , it is like , \[ wel- , \+ \] the one that I worked in *T*-1 , uh , you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day , E_S
146620:33	and then you would \[ see \+ see \] some of the others that *T*-1 \[ are \+ were \] like distant from the other group E_S
146621:60	and they they just did n't like participate together with the others because they had \[ some \+ some , \] uh , I guess , uh , slight mental disabilities and things like that . E_S
146663:14	and there are some fire stations 0 I can take newspapers to *T*-1 E_S
146711:46	And I think 0 it is going *-1 to come to that because some people will just not go to the , N_S
146767:23	Well , \[ on- , \+ some \] of them are five ,
146768:5	some are ten cents . E_S
146830:12	you see some of the stuff E_S
146883:11	You buy some E_S
146901:16	Because I had some appointments at the office *ICH*-1 today , some interviews E_S
146901:37	Because I had some appointments at the office *ICH*-1 today , some interviews E_S
146950:25	So *-1 to be taller than some of the boys in the \[ bigger grades , \+ uh , older grades , \] I had *-1 to wear heels . E_S
147069:16	I know that some of the schools they have , uh , country western day or something like that one , you know , or tacky day , E_S
147085:37	Um , oh , \[ it , \+ there 's \] some good things about it E_S
147239:53	but I think , uh , 0 we 're going *-1 to have *-2 to make some fundamental changes E_S
147292:13	and they needed some quality care , E_S
147338:27	I am sure 0 you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas . E_S
147341:8	And some of them are limited care *ICH*-2 too where people can do , uh , N_S
147478:44	So , \[ I , \+ you know , you \] pick up some traits from her and stuff . E_S
147583:29	And it *EXP*-1 's just too bad that some people , you know , still look down on them just because of their color . You know . E_S
147615:5	some people say oh the boys should n't have *-1 to do those jobs . The inside jobs . E_S
147697:28	But I wish 0 they would get some more on that . E_S
147755:52	and personally I feel 0 \[ it 's probably , \+ there 's probably \] some of each . E_S
147829:43	and it almost seems like in order *-1 to avoid , uh , some of the scandal , you would have *-1 to have the kind of wife that you would only find *T*-2 , \[ on , \+ say in \] the Bobsy twins or , something like that . E_S
147885:34	the Japanese government is always having \[ a , \+ some \] kind of a scandal . E_S
147922:86	Oh , well , I guess 0 I like a wide range . Uh , everything \[ from , \+ uh , from \] Baroque through at least some modern music . E_S
148133:33	Uh , I suppose 0 that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth , because I do get things from ski associations and things , uh , \[ at , \+ during \] the year . E_S
148187:41	I 'd like *-1 to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those . E_S
148204:16	and then we have some church magazines , E_S
148360:9	Even some of that I like *T*-1 okay but not , mostly , as a general rule , E_S
148377:14	and I like some of their songs . E_S
148462:27	\[ I , \+ I \] like some of it , um , E_S
148469:11	Um , some of it sounds more like pop music . E_S
148536:16	Um , I have some Spiro Gyro tapes . E_S
148545:11	I have some dulcimer music . E_S
148568:15	I mean , some people sing , E_S
148897:37	* Got \[ that , \+ \] uh , uh , some insight *ICH*-2 there , 0 *T*-1 \[ to , \+ to \] kind of help me put together the feelings . E_S
149155:55	You know , when you write a test *T*-1 you have *-2 to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing *T*-3 and find out which ones *T*-4 are discriminating well and which ones *T*-5 are n't *?* find out how reliable the test is *T*-6 , E_S
149169:21	Well , I was doing some of the same stuff , but doing it more slowly , and with smaller files . E_S
149231:71	Oh , we spend a lot of time outdoors *-1 jogging , bicycling , uh , going to the park , um , some time *-1 watching V C R movies um ,
149249:6	some of the things 0 we do *T*-1 together as a family , we like *-2 to play games a lot , E_S
149297:15	So you have some in the nest and some out , huh . E_S
149297:29	So you have some in the nest and some out , huh . E_S
149432:17	Oh , I have some relatives out there in Texas , E_S
149502:68	\[ he 's , \+ uh , he has \] been really aggressive , uh , especially towards my little girl , for some reason . E_S
149583:38	and we ended up with , uh , oh , malamute and some other kind of mix . E_S
149615:70	you know , I saw something *ICH*-3 on C N N or on cable here a while ago that *T*-2 showed some people that *T*-1 had rabbits in apartments and in houses , E_S
149669:8	and some of the weirdest animals 0 you ever want *-1 to see *T*-2 in there . E_S
149727:73	and especially in this election year , I think that , uh , there ought *-1 to be \[ so- , \+ at least some \] conversation about what we are supposed *-2 to do *T*-3 about this . E_S
149820:43	but with this peace dividend , it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had *?* in the thirties , or whatever . E_S
149911:186	um , what *T*-1 really bothers me is 0 it just seems like \[ if , \+ if \] anyone were *-2 to say , you know , well I 'm going *-3 to raise taxes and cut the budget and \[ we 're \+ MUMBLEx , we 're \] going *-4 to have *-5 to do some unpopular things , I mean , he would n't have a chance of * getting elected *-6 . E_S
149978:23	and , uh , they 've had some impact , but not a tremendous amount , E_S
149990:22	You know , particularly in some of the housing projects , uh , you know , \[ that 's , \+ that \] tends *-1 to be where a lot of that crime is focused *-2 *T*-3 E_S
150133:52	\[ I 've actually , \+ I 've \] \[ known , \+ known \] some people that *T*-1 have had their cars stolen *-2 . E_S
150146:7	and some superficial type damage , E_S
150248:40	and the , uh , microwave had *-1 to have , uh , some kind of something 0 I ca n't even pronounce *T*-2 , E_S
150976:42	if you wanted *-1 to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it E_S
150984:71	I guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *T*-1 is very unreasonable in some way , that , uh , you , uh , would have a problem , uh , you know , that you would n't convict someone who *T*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4 . E_S
151063:96	Yeah , I mean , \[ \[ I , \+ I \] really , \+ I would like \] *-1 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] do at some point , um , E_S
151066:23	but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does n't work as well . E_S
151118:86	\[ In , \+ in \] the case 0 you were involved in *T*-1 , you said 0 it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind . E_S
151317:32	But , uh , apparently for \[ some , \+ some \] crimes , it *EXP*-1 's permissible * to have six people sit in judgment . E_S
151348:25	it was *?* , yeah , in some of the critical things , like \[ the off- , \+ special investigations , \] at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person , E_S
151377:38	But , uh , \[ they , \+ they \] have done some testing around our office , mostly after lunch , *-1 looking for people \[ drinking , \+ uh , drinking \] beer and stuff at lunch time , E_S
151543:30	Well , you know , you can take some of \[ that , \+ that \] testing a little bit too far . E_S
151564:32	I mean * suppose 0 they found out some other way ? E_S
151577:22	Uh , like I said , some industries , though , I think 0 it 'd be very necessary , E_S
151774:60	And , uh , \[ each one of the , \+ everybody \] that *T*-1 showed up donated some money for the rent and \[ for , \+ for \] like soft drinks E_S
152257:56	and uh , our benefits package \[ is n't , \+ uh , is n't \] quite as good in some ways . Uh , you know , E_S
152303:35	\[ unless you , \+ unless you \] have some vacation time or \[ some , \+ some \] sick leave or whatever , um , you kind of have *-1 to finagle your way around *-2 to get that time . E_S
152303:56	\[ unless you , \+ unless you \] have some vacation time or \[ some , \+ some \] sick leave or whatever , um , you kind of have *-1 to finagle your way around *-2 to get that time . E_S
152490:25	I mean , you know , some people had been there a long time . E_S
152494:12	Like in some of the large oil companies . There has been massive lay offs . E_S
152569:103	although \[ he , \+ \] you know , * the more complex 0 your structure *?* *T*-2 the , uh , less difficult it *EXP*-1 is *T*-3 * to kind of carry some things through E_S
152831:108	Uh , \[ my , \+ my \] opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state E_S and they say 0 they are going *-1 to send some back , E_S
153023:355	\[ Also , \+ also \] I have the observation *ICH*-6 \[ of , \+ uh , with \] the press \[ is \+ \] that , like \[ any \+ any \] stories that I had any first hand knowledge of *T*-1 that I see *T*-2 in the press , you know , which *T*-3 only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for \[ anything of \+ you know \[ or \+ \] anything that \] *T*-4 actually \[ had , \+ had \] more than just a blurb about it . \[ That \+ \] the press has managed *-5 to just mess up some aspect of the story E_S
153314:52	\[ They 're \+ their \] cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens E_S
153357:7	and some he destroys *T*-1 E_S
153358:7	and some he keeps *T*-1 . E_S
153435:29	because I mean I do think that some people need them \[ and , \+ \] like , for protection and stuff E_S
153931:85	\[ they , \+ I guess 0 they \] passed a couple of , uh , uh , laws \[ a \+ here while back \] in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go *-1 to buy a hand gun *T*-2 E_S
153957:35	\[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 some forms of guns should probably be controlled *-1
153995:24	You know , I have done some bow hunting E_S
154149:47	Well , even if it 's not technical . If it 's , uh , some social thing or whatever . It does n't matter . E_S
154306:16	We have gotten some of our loans paid *-1 off really because of this and stuff like that E_S
154553:11	I like some country music . E_S
154734:49	and , uh , I was kind of interested *-1 to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places E_S
154759:31	They were able *-1 to sell it for some amount per ton E_S
154769:18	We *ICH*-2 're doing some here \[ in , \+ in \] Cash Valley , the community here . E_S
154782:102	So one of the real keys , it sounds like *T*-1 , to * getting recycling for , uh , paper or something like that to go is * to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it . E_S
154822:19	like a carbon fuel of some sort , E_S
154991:37	and I think 0 that keeps \[ a lot , \+ some \] people from *-1 exercising . E_S
155193:47	\[ \[ or \+ or are you , \] \+ or are \[ they \+ some home \] \] distributing the funds back to you . E_S
155202:46	\[ and then I , \+ and then they \] in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that *T*-1 do the canning of the pop and the beer \[ as \+ as \] well . E_S
155226:17	They have done it some , uh , E_S
155235:11	Uh , some of the , N_S
155242:12	I have some friends of mine who *T*-1 use Quicken E_S
155281:73	but , uh , we 're to the point *ICH*-1 now where our financial income is enough that we can consider *-2 putting some away for college *T*-3 , E_S
155300:12	* find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way 0 we will be able *-1 to , uh , do it *T*-2 . E_S
155307:76	Well our situation is just \[ a little bit , \+ kind of the opposite \] of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently , uh , took on a full time job ,
155336:38	Uh , a colleague of mine at , uh , work got some information over , uh , the computer network called * INTERNET . E_S
155363:18	we could talk about some of the long range goals E_S
155368:62	Uh , well I think , 0 either my wife or I would like *-1 to pursue advanced degrees at some point E_S
155415:45	We 're trying *-1 to think of how * to put away some savings and stuff like that *T*-2 E_S
155421:27	we 'd like *-1 to do that some day . E_S
155612:26	\[ So \+ so \] there is some good to it . E_S
155641:88	if my parents were *-1 to get ill , I would like *-2 to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help . E_S
155671:20	and then there 's also some that *T*-1 are set *-2 up for specialties E_S
155675:16	uh , I know some . E_S
155676:10	Unfortunately , some elderly \[ have * to go to \+ or have , \] I guess 0 it 's *RNR*-2 Alzheimer 's or where they wonder \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , confused or have some mental problem *T*-1 . E_S
155676:120	Unfortunately , some elderly \[ have * to go to \+ or have , \] I guess 0 it 's *RNR*-2 Alzheimer 's or where they wonder \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , confused or have some mental problem *T*-1 . E_S
155726:30	and \[ I \+ I 've \] seen some of them like that too E_S
155768:23	Uh , guy , E_S uh , some of my things , E_S \[ I , \+ I 'd \] like *-1 to have a short work week you know , E_S
155945:65	I think 0 by *-1 putting term limitations on \[ you could , \+ you could \] slow down some of the problems . E_S
155950:11	I know some senators , E_S
156065:131	But \[ I , \+ I \] think that \[ there are , \+ there are \] advantages to * having seniority \[ and , \+ uh , \[ turn- , \+ \] or , \] not having a complete turnover every , some small number of years . E_S
156153:21	and I think also 0 some of the , uh , car companies are coming out with , uh , gas powered fleets so you , N_S
156223:103	Well , you also have the very close related thing of the , uh , rain forest destruction which *T*-1 is the main source of what *T*-2 's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants . E_S
156247:36	Well , \[ not , \+ not \] as hard as some places out west because you do n't get the , uh , major pollution sources as you do out in Denver *ICH*-2 with the inversion and Los Angeles and \[ a- , \+ \] rest of California which *T*-1 is just terrible it sounds . E_S
156419:18	I had , uh , some visitor E_S
156618:53	I mean , it *EXP*-1 seems absurd that people will pay , you know , some bucks just *-2 to get someone to , N_S
156793:8	but some of them have already been in youth centers . And that kind of thing , E_S
156804:8	and some of them are our problems , E_S
156825:41	but if you could find a way 0 * to prevent some of it *T*-4 , and I 'm not sure what it would be *T*-1 . It would be money better *ICH*-2 spent * than , N_S
156851:33	I 'm for it \[ in \+ in \] some cases . E_S
157050:25	I think 0 I 've seen some statistics that *T*-1 say that , uh , it *EXP*-2 's more expensive *ICH*-3 * to kill somebody than * to keep them in prison for life . E_S
157092:10	but in some cases , yes . E_S
157203:39	well , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 on some of it , you have *-1 to say 0 someone 's responsible for his actions . E_S
157650:23	I 've been out here twenty some years E_S
157668:160	Well , \[ the , \+ the \] one thing that I know 0 *T*-1 does seem *-2 to happen from people 0 I 've talked to *T*-3 on this , is that in the situation 0 you just said *T*-4 where it 's nine to three , or some such number *T*-5 , \[ that there 's , an effect 0 *T*-7 starts *-8 being \+ that there 's starts *-6 being \] a lot of peer pressure going on E_S
157673:10	and in some cases if it 's a long trial , the desire *ICH*-1 of people *-2 to get out of there and not be stuck *-2 in there for a very long time , that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons . E_S
157676:109	I 'd read one book , I think 0 it was calls *-1 TRIAL BY JURY of all things , that , uh *T*-2 went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases , and in many cases *-3 looking \[ at what *T*-4 had , \+ \] at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right , went back to the jurors , uh , based on the deliberations . E_S
158089:67	Well , I do think 0 with working parents \[ it is , \+ I mean , there are \] some real issues here . Um , that I think , um , N_S
158116:34	And it has , um , helped us to afford some things for our children that we could n't otherwise *?* *T*-2 that I think 0 *T*-1 are wonderful particularly at this age , E_S
158232:209	And I think that the people who *T*-1 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level . E_S Uh , you know , whether it be a biblical force , uh , you know , the eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a life for a \[ knife , \+ life \] type logic or just , uh , uh , some sort of anger at * \[ putting peop- , \+ putting , uh , murderers \] up in federal pens for the rest of their life , uh , while we foot the bill . E_S
158276:20	like * say 0 some young kids or something like that that *T*-1 might be inclined more towards a life of crime , had *-2 to sit and watch \[ and , \+ and \] see a guy burn \[ or , \+ or , \] you know , something or shot *-3 by a firing squad or something like that . E_S
158338:52	but I ca n't imagine that they would do an all white jury without *-1 having some sort \[ of , \+ of \] discrimination \[ or , \+ or , \] you know , uh , appeal on * not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff . E_S
158343:99	It 's like they 're saying well on the one hand \[ they 're not , \+ he 's not \] getting a jury of his peers which *T*-1 is in some ways I think 0 *T*-2 true . E_S
158370:62	but \[ I , \+ I \] rather imagine 0 \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] some snickering about it . And a lot of the usually fatalistic , uh , here we go again folks , kind of stuff . E_S
158417:27	\[ She , \+ she \] had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice \[ with the , \+ with the \] owner of the store . E_S
158417:44	\[ She , \+ she \] had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice \[ with the , \+ with the \] owner of the store . E_S
158525:22	this child was crying and needed some comfort , you know , E_S
158631:39	but \[ they also did , \+ they also did \] some of the teaching things E_S
158665:46	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 there 's definitely been some changes , um , E_S
158704:32	and it must have reflected , uh , uh , some awful good , uh , diplomacy on the part of the U S . E_S
158902:45	well I did work , um , \[ just very \+ \] MUMBLEx for some time E_S
159122:18	then I know of some of the people that *T*-1 have gotten their masters E_S
159194:33	But \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] some weird law where , uh , uh , student employees working for the government do n't have *-1 to pay Social Security tax *T*-2 . E_S
159266:27	And I think 0 maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous , you know , like millions and millions of dollars . E_S
159274:140	Each individual jury really does n't have any perception of what , um , \[ the going , \+ you know , if you will *?* the going , \] uh , award should be *T*-1 for a certain type of case , you know , within some kind of range . E_S
159280:82	Who it really penalizes *T*-1 is their insurance company which *T*-2 then translates into higher rates for all of us . If they get some of those mega awards against them . E_S
159294:21	And , uh , granted 0 some people need *-1 to be compensated *-2 if they have really been wronged *-3 , you know . E_S
159296:86	Well , how do you feel *T*-2 about * setting , like , well , for example , \[ a car type accident where , \+ uh , or some incident \] where someone loses a limb *T*-1 . E_S
159302:14	You know some of the health insurance is written *-1 that way . You know , that , uh , if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy , you know , it s- , pre specified in the policy so much E_S
159312:47	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it has *-1 to be some kind of common sense applied * there . E_S
159389:10	But in some instances you 're going *-1 to put companies out of business by *-2 taking that stance , if they have *-3 to take it out of their own retained earnings . E_S
159437:33	And , uh , then I had *-1 to do some volunteer work here in Tyler , Texas E_S
159514:8	And some of the really nice ones that *T*-1 really take care of their people are so expensive . \[ Because \+ cause \] they can afford *-2 to hire the people that *T*-3 are really going * to care for the older . E_S
159743:40	\[ I , \+ I \] even like Guns and Roses , some of their stuff . E_S
159747:15	But , uh , some of these groups now like Slaughter . E_S
159970:32	I guess that * 's not large compared to some , E_S
160240:29	Uh , you know , as sort of some development and some training , uh , E_S
160240:36	Uh , you know , as sort of some development and some training , uh , E_S
160313:29	but , I think 0 there should be some kind of curbside service . E_S
160637:88	and for the longer term \[ I , \+ I \] read , uh , like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , READERS ' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that *T*-1 come out which , they , N_S
160756:8	And some of it , I mean , is , N_S
160911:102	well , \[ \[ I , \+ I mean , \] \+ I think \] 0 \[ there 's some people , \+ there , \[ y- , \+ \] certainly are some things \] where you need infrastructure *T*-1 E_S
161150:10	but also some poodles , uh E_S
161155:11	there are some smart ones out there , E_S
161156:26	but there 's \[ some \+ also some , \] uh , not so smart ones . E_S
161163:79	\[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] \+ maybe \[ that 's , \+ there 's , \] \] uh , some credence in that statement . E_S
161180:15	I mean , some people seem fairly well suited \[ for \+ for , \] uh , miniature poodles and such . E_S
161209:14	Well , because some people , uh , want *-1 to train them as , N_S
161272:36	they 're banned *-1 \[ from , \+ in \] some areas I understand 0 *T*-2 . E_S
161349:39	Well , \[ you should , \+ you should \] have some opinions on that , then . E_S
161351:15	I do have some thoughts on that , E_S
161449:22	I 'm into , uh , some industrial music that *T*-1 's , \[ a , \+ a \] bit even harder than that . E_S
161543:23	but I also dislike , uh , some classical music , E_S
161659:14	so you got some lakes around 0 you can do that on *T*-1 . E_S
161792:24	I 'd like *-1 to do some sailing . E_S
161826:7	but some people are more motorboaters , you know which *T*-1 is fine . E_S
161841:21	\[ you actually , \+ some catamarans you can actually \] pull people *ICH*-1 behind *T*-2 , the skiers , E_S
162098:63	But \[ I keep , \+ I keep \] *-1 thinking that there 's got *-2 to be some way , \[ that , \+ that \] a lot of this is circumstances *T*-3 . E_S
162141:71	* Stop *-1 trying *-3 to attack supply \[ because , \+ \] \[ which , \+ which \] to some extent *T*-2 makes sense and to some extent *T*-2 does n't . E_S
162141:91	* Stop *-1 trying *-3 to attack supply \[ because , \+ \] \[ which , \+ which \] to some extent *T*-2 makes sense and to some extent *T*-2 does n't . E_S
162164:33	and , uh , we 're looking at , uh , some just four door , five passenger sedans as well . E_S
162325:44	\[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] hard * to beat some of the , N_S
162412:56	but , uh , there 's a four O one K plan uh , for , uh , * sheltering some taxable income . E_S
162478:59	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that E_S
162807:36	Something 0 I picked *T*-1 up in a psychology class some time ago . E_S
162812:65	it 's that * the younger 0 they are *T*-2 , they tend *-1 to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason , E_S
162828:72	Well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such *T*-1 . I think 0 there ought *-2 to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this . E_S
163289:33	I think 0 at each Wal-Mart , they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that , which *T*-1 now , N_S
163356:17	Uh , I bought some Cokes *ICH*-1 the other day in \[ the br- , \+ the little bottles \] you know , E_S
163402:36	but \[ I , \+ I \] do know 0 some of these places were doing that E_S
163458:200	and \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 \[ \[ I 'll do this for , \+ I was doing this for , \] \+ actually , I was going *-1 to do it for \] my son \[ so that he could , \+ uh , \[ he , \+ he 's \] in high school , so that he could \] make some money . E_S
163531:87	But I think 0 it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have *-1 to exercise some quick judgment in the field . E_S
163578:60	\[ \[ I guess \+ I k- , \] \+ I think \] 0 it 's got some relevance , E_S
163598:67	\[ they 're , \+ they should \] be able *-1 to make it as a continue of employment in some sense E_S
163649:39	\[ and , \+ and \] supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn 0 * to retire *T*-1 *T*-2 , the money will be there for us . E_S
163673:61	I 'm not sure if we know what * to do *T*-2 in terms of * curing some who *T*-1 has already gotten polio . E_S
163682:37	\[ \[ that , \+ that histor- , \] \+ for some reason , historical sites \] with , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] full federal money and everything seem *-1 to appear \[ \[ as , \+ as \] \+ almost as \] like political favors \[ to , \+ to \] very strong politicians . E_S
163691:87	So , it sounds like \[ you , \+ uh , you \] think \[ that , \+ that \] we 'd be able *-1 to save some money by , uh *-2 passing the line item veto . E_S
163717:52	\[ \[ The- , \+ the- , \] \+ there \] has *-1 to be some way 0 * to do it *T*-2 . E_S
163775:38	I 'm more , uh , old rock and roll , uh , some \[ new , \+ newer , \] I guess 0 you would call it *ICH*-1 heavy metal rock and roll type you know , uh , Van Halen , that kind of thing . E_S
163790:21	So , \[ some \+ some \] of the older Eagles stuff was good . E_S
163805:15	But , uh , some of their older \[ s- , \+ stuff \] was , uh , you know , quite enjoyable to me . E_S
163819:68	Uh , so , anything new 0 you like *T*-1 *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 coming out now , other than folk music , some 0 I might know of *T*-2 . E_S
163851:17	I think 0 some of them , the artists are even , uh , hitting the pop charts . E_S
163972:57	see , that 's one thing 0 I like *T*-1 about \[ the , \+ uh , some \] of the folk music scenes , you know , E_S
164027:11	There are some , but \[ not , \+ not \] very high . E_S
164181:49	I know 0 \[ they s- , \+ they 're coming \] out with some V eight now E_S
164186:18	so , they 've got some pretty powerful sixes . E_S
164198:48	but there 's so many occasions when I 've had *-1 to move some members of the family or do this or that *T*-2 , E_S
164221:38	and we were n't aware of it , and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car , E_S
164223:15	So , we got some monster studded snow tires after that . E_S
164239:23	and it 's , uh , got some nice features in terms of * being able *-1 to remove seats and flip them around E_S
164243:29	so we 've been able *-1 to do some real creative , uh , load hauling when * called upon *-2 *T*-3 . E_S
164258:56	I think that we 're going *-1 to be , uh , owning a mini van for some years 0 *T*-2 to come . E_S
164333:23	\[ I , \+ \] in some ways , it 's almost worse than murder . E_S
164407:36	But , I think 0 you have *-1 to accept some of the errors . E_S
164495:23	Well , I think that in some cases , it is warranted . E_S
164502:18	I think 0 in some cases it *EXP*-1 does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not . E_S
164519:13	Well , for some things . E_S
164556:49	But , then , you know , I think \[ that , \+ that \] some murderers do n't really warrant capital punishment . You know , \[ just , \+ \] like , for example , uh , you know , you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who *T*-1 abused them *T*-2 E_S
164793:53	Although \[ I , \+ you know , I 'm \] sorry *-1 to see some of their , uh , N_S
164929:134	One of the things that I found *T*-1 interesting last year during \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Gulf conflict was a sentiment against , uh , Peter Arnett , who *T*-2 had stayed in Iraq and was presenting , uh , some of the things that *T*-3 were available . E_S
165017:60	There was n't as many advanced placement courses *ICH*-3 , uh , when I was a senior *T*-1 that some other schools had *T*-2 . E_S
165108:23	* ended up *-1 getting some scholarships 0 * to go to college *T*-2 \[ and \+ \] \[ which *T*-3 has been , \+ you know , which *T*-4 is \] really nice , E_S
165389:35	the other thing 0 I let them do *T*-1 some times is that I let them go through and \[ let them tell me what , \+ let them do \] the diagnostics . E_S
165437:28	Well it sounds like you 've had some good experiences with that E_S
165669:42	and then with that I try and handle , you know , some of the clothes that the girls need *T*-1 and things like that , E_S
165759:38	and then you have *-1 to really sit down and plan some more E_S
165808:15	I 've heard some about Saturns . E_S
165842:31	And I found that while you can find some cars that *T*-1 are comfortable 0 * to ride in *T*-2 , uh , * finding a \[ ca- , \+ car \] *ICH*-5 anymore \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-4 's \] fairly easy 0 for me to work on *T*-6 , \[ it 's just not very eas- , \+ it 's not very , \] N_S
165905:15	I 've driven some , uh , Tauruses *ICH*-2 over the last couple of years when I 've been on business trips *T*-1 . Uh , as rental cars . E_S
166012:17	\[ Some , \+ some \] local communities are very active \[ in that , \+ uh , in that \] respect E_S
166058:129	I think 0 here \[ if they , \+ uh , instead of * just , you know , requiring that you \[ put , \+ put \] out the trash and stuff , if they *ICH*-2 \] could get some kind of rebate , those people who *T*-1 do put the stuff out , uh , you know , and separate it , have lower collection fee or something * may encourage people to separate . E_S
166099:34	Now I think 0 they 've come up with some way of , uh , * pulling the glue out . E_S
166239:186	And then , sometimes \[ I , \+ I \] often , uh , find that maybe there 's so many different things available to us . \[ Yo- , \+ \] a microwave , a V C R , a answering machine \[ \[ a , \+ you know , a special , \] \+ a \] dishwasher , uh , a refrigerator and some of those items , um , \[ for the , \+ for the , \] uh , N_S
166324:27	I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know *T*-1 personally get paid *-2 an awful lot more than , N_S
166332:14	But there are some school districts out there that *T*-1 are very well paid . E_S
166609:11	That 's some brutal stuff there . E_S
166790:41	Oh , here 's *T*-2 an easy way 0 * to make some money *T*-1 . E_S
166792:44	\[ I , \+ I 've \] heard , fairly recently , uh , some talk about that \[ in this , \+ \[ in , \+ in \] my \] state . E_S
166920:103	Because , uh , \[ I th- , \+ you know , I think \] 0 for a lot of people it really is the decision of , do they still have some of their life left . E_S
166932:14	but there 's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able *-1 to deal with *T*-2 physically anymore . E_S
166950:129	Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer 's Disease \[ \[ or those \+ or , \] \+ or \] physical and mental handicaps . Uh , you know , where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind . Even though it may be minimal *T*-1 . E_S
166957:30	at least , I mean I think 0 some nursing homes do that . E_S
166964:64	I think that a majority of the places in the U S , uh , you know , there is some government aid available , E_S
166974:17	* Definitely does need some improvements .
167035:53	I think 0 that should be left *-2 up to people who *T*-1 have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have *?* . E_S
167062:56	Matter of fact , \[ I 've heard that , \+ I 've heard that \] some of the information *ICH*-2 , uh , is prevented *-1 from *-1 reaching the jury , like , uh , mitigating circumstances \[ or , \+ or \] preceding , uh , criminal record or things of this nature that , N_S
167130:52	Um , \[ \[ s- , \+ s- , \] \+ naturally \[ some , \+ some \] \] things you just ca n't find *T*-1 in your local K-Mart \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , Bryn Mawr stereo dealer . E_S
167175:44	And \[ there r- , \+ there are \] \[ s- , \+ some \] substantial , nasty penalties , um , \[ if you , \+ if businesses \] try *-1 to avoid that . E_S
167197:74	Uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for *-3 policing themselves , then I think 0 some well defined mechanisms need *-1 to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity \[ f- , \+ \] * to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided *-2 . E_S
167230:60	* To prevent these people from *-1 ever getting out on the street . By , you know , some technicality . E_S
167234:13	and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again *-1 doing the same 0 they did *T*-2 before . E_S
167460:11	They had some property there E_S
167520:43	and , uh they have put plastic , Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows . E_S
167853:33	Uh , although I I 'm sure 0 to some extent , that money is part of the problem in the disparity , E_S
167861:60	\[ And , \+ uh you know , and so \] the students were , you know , to some extent , motivated *-1 to learn . E_S
167923:114	So , I guess 0 \[ the problem is 0 the , \+ the thing 0 * to do *T*-1 is \] * to try *-2 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get some kind of motivation * to learn E_S
168092:41	They 'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense . E_S
168240:39	If you have yard trash , you put your yard trash in some kind of container . E_S
168375:16	But they get into some really good conversations sometimes , you know . E_S
168376:8	And some of it , sometimes it 's serious E_S
168377:14	and they have some good feedback and all that stuff E_S
168394:161	Uh , and \[ really , \+ \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ we \] were really \] forced *-2 into *-3 keeping a budget because \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] paid once a month which *T*-1 \[ sort of , \+ sort of \] forces some , uh , uh , restrictions E_S
168678:18	Like I said , some years ago , I think 0 I would have said 0 there 's no place for capital punishment in the , civilized western country . E_S
168694:29	I 'm beginning *-1 to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and , uh , that , uh , uh , costs and other factors justify , uh , uh , * executing people . E_S
168702:40	and , uh I can imagine that , uh , uh , for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case . E_S
168731:49	Not so much because , uh , it 's bad per se , although there is some pretty crappy programming E_S
168732:33	and \[ I thin- , \+ there 's also some , uh , I think , \] uh , poorer lifestyles illustrated * but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time . E_S
168933:15	But there were some things *ICH*-3 that people brought *T*-1 up like well what *T*-2 happens if \[ they , \+ they \] get a false positive , you know , what recourse do you have *T*-4 . E_S
168948:53	and \[ if they 're , \+ you know , if they 're \] on some kind of , you know , \[ contol- , \+ controlled \] substance then , you know , it kinds of takes away from the job of , you know , the supervisor or manager type person , you know , who *T*-1 is able *-2 to evaluate them . E_S
169040:30	Either you have , uh , military service or some sort of alternative , nonmilitary service for a few years . E_S
169077:64	\[ for , \+ for \] years there has been an idea *ICH*-2 batted * around of * having some sort of alternative , uh , public service 0 for , uh , young people to go into *T*-3 , uh , after high school . E_S
169087:61	and \[ \[ they , \+ they at least have , \] \+ now they have at least \] some marginally marketable skills and more discipline . E_S
169088:56	And \[ they have , \+ uh , you know , \[ in , \+ in \] some cases they have \] a greater self-esteem because \[ they can say , \+ they can see \] that , you know , if I do something or \[ sub- , \+ submit \] my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever , at least for a short period of time , I can accomplish a lot E_S
169093:37	And , you know , \[ for some , \+ for some \] young men , that 's good . E_S
169102:41	\[ so . \+ But , \] uh , you know , for some people that 's good . E_S
169134:30	Uh , I know that there 's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders . E_S
169138:54	Uh , that *ICH*-1 's kind of gone up in scale \[ and , \+ and \] some other things . E_S
169475:51	and \[ I can , \+ I can , \] you know , accept that some people think 0 it 's not *?* and can find better ways 0 * to use it *T*-1 . E_S
169520:110	We ended up *-2 watching it for a couple of hours . Zooming out and grabbing something 0 * to eat *T*-1 and then zooming back and \[ ea- , \+ watching \] it some more . E_S
169775:14	and they had some guy that *T*-1 was , uh , defending himself . E_S
169826:13	and it was some Malaria medication E_S
169900:67	So you know , I guess 0 \[ you sort of , \+ you \] have *-1 to have trust some place along the way . E_S
169930:79	I mean \[ a lot of , \+ a lot of \] people as kids or , you know , young people get into some things that they get out of *T*-1 later on E_S
169968:20	Uh , but , uh , some friends of mine have , uh , gone through this . E_S
169969:80	I think 0 I 'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention *T*-1 and , uh , where they did some things *-2 to try *-3 to keep them , um , mentally alive *T*-4 . And \[ where there was , uh , caring and compassionate , \+ where there were caring and compassionate \] people , uh , operating it *T*-5 . E_S
170002:63	We used *-1 to go \[ once a month , \+ once every two months \] *-2 to visit some of the patients there . E_S
170010:51	Do you think that in the case of the one that you 've actually had some experience with *T*-1 , that the people who *T*-2 operate it seem *-3 to have , what you 'd perceive of *T*-4 as genuine concern ? E_S
170014:94	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] think sometimes , \+ you know , I 've noticed , \] uh , \[ people asking for , \+ uh , some of the patients asking for \] things *ICH*-1 , uh , just repetitively \[ and , \+ but \] things that *T*-2 are not reasonable , E_S
170018:13	and so at some level \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] uh , N_S
170051:85	and it did n't look like , uh , you know , how , \[ \[ yo- , \+ you , \] \+ you \] walk into some rooms *T*-1 E_S and \[ there 's , \+ it 's \] completely generic . E_S
170133:26	A couple of times we 've tried some things E_S
170298:14	We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech . E_S
170298:23	We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech . E_S
170355:33	So there should be something *ICH*-2 in there or some kind of clause that *T*-1 will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than , you know , uh , neglect or something like that . E_S
170605:50	and I do n't think 0 our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some . E_S
170848:36	Because I know 0 my grandparents wanted *-1 to have some independence still . E_S
170852:13	They wanted some place 0 they can go and have their meals *T*-1 and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her E_S
170860:12	there was some sort of full-time care place that *T*-1 was also associated *-2 with it E_S
170966:55	Uh , I 've had , uh , three boys *ICH*-1 through , I guess , uh , some child care , each one of them E_S
170980:30	You 'd like *-1 to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care . E_S
170998:111	\[ are n't \+ do n't \] \[ they kind of use them for , \+ everybody kind of use them for \] guinea pigs ? \[ For their per- , \+ for their pet theories \] or some such thing ? E_S
171044:26	and \[ they finding , \+ in some cases they 're finding \] 0 it *EXP*-1 's just not worth it * to work because it 's all going out in daycare . E_S
171232:7	some of that is really bad I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
171309:31	Well I think 0 the court systems could stand some improvement . E_S
171392:65	but \[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 I like the system that they have *T*-1 in some places where the defendant \[ gets *-3 to choose whether he 's , \+ goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets *T*-2 to choose \] it *T*-4 . E_S
171393:18	\[ Some , \+ some \] cases in some jurisdictions , they can do that . E_S
171393:29	\[ Some , \+ some \] cases in some jurisdictions , they can do that . E_S
171406:112	But , the thing is too , 0 maybe they need \[ more of a , \+ I do n't know , more of a \] expert types \[ to , \+ to \] be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick , you know , Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever \[ an- , \+ and \] call them in . E_S
171448:70	But I think 0 \[ about , \+ uh , about \] a year ago , uh , I bought a product from some company down \[ at , \+ uh , in \] Atlanta , Georgia . E_S
171454:40	but I found that , uh , it was made *-1 of some material which *T*-2 actually ended up *-3 rusting uh , after , N_S
171568:49	and they will gladly , no questions asked *-1 , take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide 0 you do n't want it anymore . E_S
171787:14	They 've had some serious problems in the past couple of years . E_S
171801:25	and , uh , they 've had some financial problems with the team and so forth . E_S
171802:32	And it recently was sold *-1 to , uh , some other people E_S
171877:28	and that 's suppose *-1 to be some of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] male bonding \[ and the , \+ and the , \] uh , the male instincts , I guess 0 *T*-2 , or something about the , uh , N_S
172028:13	we do some cooking , some barbecueing , have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat , drink some more . E_S
172028:20	we do some cooking , some barbecueing , have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat , drink some more . E_S
172028:93	we do some cooking , some barbecueing , have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat , drink some more . E_S
172041:88	that you miss *T*-1 *-2 sitting home in your parlor , you know , uh , \[ with , \+ with \] a six pack of beer and some , uh , potato chips , you know E_S
172078:56	\[ I , \+ I \] kind of agree with that , because I think 0 in some cases , uh , the jury may not even have , the information about other crimes 0 the person has committed *T*-1 . E_S
172086:38	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think that in some cases that 's considered *-1 to prejudice the current case E_S
172116:15	there would be some types of crimes for which you 're not guaranteed *-1 a jury trial *T*-2 ? E_S
172153:17	But I meant for some , when both parties agreed that yes , we 're going *-1 to have a judge here *T*-2 . E_S
172313:40	I 've found that most of homework assignments MUMBLEx really require some sort of computer , uh , simulation or analysis , E_S
172344:12	I have some games *ICH*-2 , of course , which I play *T*-1 on there E_S
172383:115	I mean , obviously , I do \[ most of my , \+ almost all of my \] report writing \[ on , \+ on \] my computer , uh , whether it 's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments . E_S
172560:22	* Still 's that way to some extent . E_S
172708:132	\[ When you have the , \+ when you have \[ the , \+ uh , the \] \] economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has *T*-1 *T*-2 , \[ and \+ \] you can , uh , offer some incentive E_S
172751:34	There ought *-4 to be , uh , uh , some compromise \[ that *T*-1 could , \+ \[ where , uh , \+ where \] the person would \] be guaranteed *-2 a , uh , career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh , in exchange for a longer period of time *T*-3 . E_S
172778:10	at least some companies .
172791:51	There 's no other way . I mean uh , unless they 're part of some extended family which *T*-1 is unlikely .
173236:19	If I only had some place that I could store the , uh , camper top *T*-1 , I would have it off most of the time . E_S
173415:8	but some of them are very rich E_S
173845:19	and by definition , for some of us , at least , the public good includes * having an educated populace and then idea that , uh , you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes \[ in the , \+ at the \] local level or bigger votes at the national level . E_S
173933:38	Well , when mine were growing up *T*-1 , I did some traveling \[ and \+ but \] not that extensively E_S
174279:15	I 've got some friends that *T*-1 are lawyers E_S
174317:40	When I was , a couple of years ago , involved in some pretrial stuff *T*-1 and N_S
174424:30	And , in fact , they 're even letting some go . E_S
174502:49	\[ if some , \+ if it *EXP*-1 were possible * to market some , \] uh , form of , uh , space technology , you know , * \[ to , \+ uh , uh , to \] make it equitable , it might severely help the economy , you know , \[ in the , \+ in the , \] uh , respect that , you know , there 's endless amounts of research 0 *T*-2 to be done *-3 .

174506:31	it would be great if we could find some way 0 * \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , use that * to boost the economy *T*-1 . E_S
174512:105	I 've always , uh , felt that , uh , uh , one of the long-term solutions that , at least a few of our problems would be * to have , uh , some sort of , uh , solar power satellites up . E_S
174529:151	So the side effects of * doing that which I think 0 *T*-1 would be good , you know , very , very good \[ for al- , \+ for everyone \] in the long run \[ is , \+ uh , is \] \[ it , \+ 0 some \] of the other things 0 I 'd like *-2 to see *T*-3 happen would happen also , E_S
174561:139	the only commitments that they 're interested in *-1 making *T*-2 or even talking about *T*-2 are ones for flash value like , uh , the trip to Mars . Which *T*-3 \[ \[ is , \+ would , \] \+ would \] produce some useful scientific research and so forth , E_S
174665:8	In some ways I do n't like it because it 's like they 're playing God . E_S
174676:23	and , of course , you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money *-1 keeping people in jail or not .
174889:107	And I guess 0 the only drawback *ICH*-2 0 I can see *T*-1 \[ to , \+ to \] drug testing is \[ in , \+ 0 in \] case you are on some sort of medication that *T*-3 might give some , uh , sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem . E_S

174908:32	Like if you 're on a prescription drug of some kind , you know , what are they going *-1 to do *T*-2 about that . E_S
174958:20	So , uh , there 's some noise on this end . E_S
175026:43	and while I do n't do any drugs myself , I 've seen some people who *T*-1 work there , uh , you know , smoking a joint or whatever . E_S
175492:8	Even some of the immediate things that I need *-1 to know *T*-2 , I do n't know it until the next hour E_S
175706:20	Uh , if it was some you know , * coming into the store and stuff , then \[ she would ha- , \+ whoever *T*-1 made the purchase would have \] had *-2 find some kind of , uh , you know , document E_S

175787:53	uh , E_S I guess 0 you 'd have *-1 to call them great men in some sense . E_S
175796:24	And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the , uh , early decisions of the Vietnam war . That the , uh , people saw the cold war as , uh , you had *-1 to draw a line \[ and , \+ and \] defend it . E_S
175818:89	Well , \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 we did , \+ I think 0 we did \] learn some lessons that \[ we were n't , \+ uh , we were n't \] prepared for *T*-1 , E_S
