16548:27	i, i like some of his songs, though.	yes	8
16916:77	i mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it	yes	24
16917:44	but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way.	no	11
17027:15	he's written some children's books as well	no	9
17246:8	for some reason that scared me more than anything.	no	9
17338:17	and then he has some under, uh, another name. that he's written *t*-1.	no	14
17367:44	and, after i, i graduated, i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through *t*-1 and have found that i enjoy them quite a bit, too, uh,	yes	32
17501:22	i've, uh, had some health problems that *t*-1 have led me to, uh,	no	14
17660:63	maybe if i can get interested in *-1 playing softball again this string i can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program.	no	23
17824:36	they're always in, in hawaii some place.	no	8
17870:41	i haven't watch any other ones on t v. just on some of the tapes.	yes	16
17941:27	but there has got *-1 to be some kind of punishment, for these people.	no	14
17979:30	uh, they sure are *?* just because, some innocent person, can really,	no	13
18056:61	and, but, i, don't know what else * to do *t*-1 with some of these people, that *t*-2 are,	yes	20
18121:39	and people like charles manson, and, and some of these other people, who *t*-1 were sentenced *-2 to death at the time 0 they repealed the death penalty *t*-3, were sentenced *-4 to life in prison, and are now,	yes	39
18275:22	* trying *-1 to get some color back in those, get the trees trimmed *-2 up, uh, get rid *-3 of a few weed problems and things like that.	no	29
18416:39	in fact, we put in some, uh, some more roses yesterday.	no	11
18466:131	just if you want a lot of, you know, light for underneath, that may be the, all right because we had, because we have some, we have some old fruit trees.	no	31
18540:20	and they just,, have some problems, big time problems	no	9
18601:25	they have *-1 to pay like some kind of fee per year.	no	12
18611:7	and some places, they, they, they really nail them for tax.	no	11
18679:111	my, my wife and i, we planted on the, on the south side of our, of our house we planted some gardenias.	no	22
18722:34	i, i do, uh, some lotus on it. uh, do some, uh, samna, some, uh, p f m, uh, nothing extremely complex.	no	22
18722:56	i, i do, uh, some lotus on it. uh, do some, uh, samna, some, uh, p f m, uh, nothing extremely complex.	no	22
18722:70	i, i do, uh, some lotus on it. uh, do some, uh, samna, some, uh, p f m, uh, nothing extremely complex.	no	22
18791:25	i used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased *-1 to leave it.	no	20
18834:28	uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things *t*-1.	no	19
18966:37	but i'm sure that they can, uh, find some sort of, uh, use for them if, you know, you know, there,	no	22
19175:22	and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic *t*-3 and, uh, they're recycling them into other plastics. and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that *t*-3	no	32
19189:72	and you're not going *-1 to bother *ich*-3 if you have one bag full, *-4 to drive all the way to some recycling center *-2 to turn in just your little plastic peanuts.	no	34
19285:76	the evidence is that, uh, you know, he's, he's let some, some stuff *ich*-1 go, you know, the east german situation.	no	23
19303:14	it's just some ungodly number * just to support the military machine.	no	13
19334:139	and, you know, i even had a thought *ich*-2 once that the whole iraqi thing might have been just a, a deal *-1 to go ahead and let us, uh, you know, expend some, some military hardware.	no	37
19388:44	and i think 0 he's actually, honestly trying *-1 to do some change.	no	14
19395:82	well, this would be like if somebody was elected *-1 president of the united states and suddenly took off toward, you know, just some pretty hard by the socialism,	no	29
19448:8	and some of the countries that *t*-1 were forced *-3 in at th-, later dates is the three baltic countries, you know, 0 *t*-2 came in, in the forties,	yes	29
19509:16	you know, some reason or other, you know, is, uh,	no	10
19543:12	they had some real fancy names for them.	no	8
19590:19	although, i've seen some evidence that, you know, the, uh, the russian soldiers are,	no	15
19737:29	it was made *-2 * to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, you know, it was, uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who *t*-1 were in areas, uh, in rebellion against the united states.	yes	46
19768:12	where's some reference to this goddamn state of texas and the role that they played *t*-1 either leading up to *rnr*-2 or in *rnr*-2 the civil war *t*-3.	no	29
19784:13	they were some groups of it, the vicksburg,	no	8
19785:106	if you ever get a chance * to go over to vicksburg, the battleground at vicksburg, uh, there's an area there where there was, uh, some texas, uh, groups *t*-1	no	31
19973:6	some of those get very philosophical	yes	6
20043:15	um, well, some history, books are pretty scary,	no	8
20089:20	even better than jaws and some of that?	yes	8
20186:238	well, i think 0 in a way, though, uh, uh, i also have, uh, an opposite point of view, which *t*-1 is, uh, 0 although i believe 0 we should, uh, permit, uh, you know, constant immigration into this country uh, i think 0 we should, uh, primarily for economic reasons, i think 0 we should have, um, some quotas,	no	60
20214:27	there are, were some, uh, regulations *ich*-2 over, i don't know whether they're laws passed * or, or whatever they're called *-4 *t*-1, uh, just recently, where, uh, people with certain diseases can not be excluded *-5, uh, from, uh, immigration *t*-3.	no	45
20220:49	so i think 0 in, in some as-, some ways we are, uh, becoming a little too egalitarian in that, in that sense,	no	23
20350:44	i thought 0 maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there.	no	17
20761:27	well, i know that we have some relatives that *t*-1 live around, like the mumblex area in there,	no	18
20765:24	i know 0 they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there.	no	16
20769:130	when they first started *-2 doing that in the paper, and i read about that *t*-1, i was just praying that, that would be in our area, because we've been recycling for quite some time.	no	36
20777:51	they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind wal-mart, that *t*-1 take some things.	no	19
20777:80	they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind wal-mart, that *t*-1 take some things.	no	19
20879:37	and so, you know, when i found out some places 0 * to take it *t*-1 *t*-2,	no	17
20880:33	and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there,	no	19
20881:73	and i know that they're going *-1 to use, you know, the money for that *-2 to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. put lights and stuff	no	33
21056:15	but, uh, some of the crap that *t*-1's on t v nowadays, it's about.	yes	16
21159:16	i think 0 some of the tones of the, the daily prime time is questionable,	yes	15
21294:51	in fact, there was one show that he even turned down a date with some, you know, beautiful woman *t*-1 just because the idea that he was, his mind was on the ozone layer and, you know, global warming and all this other kind of stuff.	no	46
22053:6	some of them are interested.	yes	5
22453:44	you didn't get a big kick out of *-1 killing them like some people do?	no	16
22479:112	so, i have not done, uh, much freshwater fishing oh, for, you know, lake, lake fishing for bass and so forth but, uh, maybe some what they call *t*-1 brim and those sorts of things, but nothing,	no	37
22666:79	of course what i used *-1 to like *-2 to do *t*-3 though is * go *-4 snorkeling for scallops *ich*-5 in some of the bays, or uh, or oy-, for oysters.	yes	32
22692:30	so, we thought well, maybe there are some crab in here,	no	11
22693:24	we'll try *-1 to catch some crab.	no	8
22733:57	i guess 0 the weirdest thing 0 i've ever caught *t*-1 is, uh, in some of the inlets and the rivers around mumblex delaware.	yes	25
22835:54	but, um, we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted *-1 to give him some medication * to sort of, you know keep him real out of it all the time	no	32
22968:14	now there is some really nice ones.	no	7
22969:26	there's also, you know, some private ones, you know	no	10
23028:35	and then on the other hand, i've seen 0 some people go into the nursing home and * just so happy you know.	no	24
23053:56	but i guess 0 once you get ill, then, you know, you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things.	no	25
23171:117	* seems so much easier *ich*-3 *-1 just to take it and throw it in the trash, and have them pick it up than it *exp*-4 is *?* * to smash the cans and drive it some place * to have them.	no	43
23212:31	but, um you know, occasionally we have some around,	no	9
23264:36	i'm sure 0 they're probably doing that here some.	no	11
23467:135	well, i think, i think 0 basically we're in a lot of agreement, uh, in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs, uh, some kind of legal definition.	no	40
23477:25	maybe there ought *-1 to be some kind of, of, uh, mumblex	no	12
23544:59	and * let's, you know, let's get rid *-1 of some of this harassment suing.	yes	17
23576:17	it's in there some place.	no	6
23663:12	what are some of your favorite foods *t*-1?	yes	8
23667:30	i imagine 0 in argentina you've got some great foods.	no	11
23674:35	we got, we got what some people call *t*-1 the best beef in the world.	no	15
23895:103	and if you like chinese food, you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some, uh, waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done,	no	57
23895:131	and if you like chinese food, you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some, uh, waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done,	no	57
23945:10	uh, some chopped up scall-, um, you know, slivers of scallions. and slivers of ginger.	no	15
24028:26	* use the same hoi sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables.	yes	14
24088:35	depending upon the field, i know 0 there are some fields which a person should go to the school, that school, all four years *t*-1,	no	25
24089:24	but i know 0 there are some fields where it's really not necessary *t*-1.	no	15
24225:42	and, um, i also have a good languages background, linguistics. and some psychology.	no	13
24373:25	it never hurts * to have some kind of a grounding in law.	no	13
24421:46	i, i thought 0 maybe you might have had some experience with the, uh, r c one thirty-fives.	no	18
24451:17	they actually should do some reading	no	6
24454:49	and it, and if it's possible * even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it.	no	22
24454:71	and it, and if it's possible * even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it.	no	22
24476:15	there are just some people that i, you know,	no	9
24487:125	i, i, i hate, um, *-1 having *-2 to play such a nice guy. you know, especially when it's all phony *t*-3. especially when you got some, uh, jerk coming in *t*-4.	no	33
24597:29	if someone's having personal problems *ich*-2 for some reason that *t*-1's causing them to h-, behave differently	no	19
24612:128	and, and it's and it's based *-4 on, on a perception that someone has *t*-3 as how a drug user would behave *t*-2 when some drug users behave, uh, normal *t*-1, uh, you know.	no	36
24638:25	so see i, for some reason, i've come up three times.	no	12
24803:52	well, that's really too bad because it, it's giving some people unfair advantage.	no	15
24830:9	and some of the, the better parts of the metroplex, the, the suburbs that *t*-1 are richer have those kind of target schools.	yes	23
24834:125	it's like if, if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that, there's no reason that you should take college prep courses *t*-1 when you can get some general business courses in high school *t*-2.	no	42
24878:26	and, you know, there's some kids that, you know, *t*-1 want *-2 to go *-3 learn,	no	17
24943:14	i can see some lady,	no	5
24991:33	maybe we do, we need some more catholic schools,	no	9
24994:15	in, uh, some places, uh, you couldn't go to a public school.	no	13
25042:19	uh, we also have some two year college.	no	8
25102:16	and i'm not some kind of an idiot,	no	9
25303:88	well, um, oh, i guess 0 another thing 0 i've noticed *t*-1, too, here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days, it's been awfully gray, you know, just,	no	35
25370:30	they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather. you know	no	15
25508:57	and, uh, we'll get out of the driving range and, and get some interest built *-1 up	no	18
25637:32	and then, you know, we've got some guys here that *t*-1 they are, you know, four and five handicappers	no	20
26087:51	well, * having, having been out of the credit game for some years now, i've gotten used to *-1 either paying in cash or not getting it.	no	28
26317:56	and, and, it's, it's limited application in some respects.	no	11
26650:33	or maybe * offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive * to do it. uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know,	no	26
26760:65	and, and that way, *-1 handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.	no	18
26781:37	but, they would have *-1 to be supported *-2 in some way,	no	12
26792:39	or would they really, you know, make a contribution of some kind.	no	12
26844:30	and, i think, that they could get some results from that, because there are a lot of people who *t*-1 are volunteer and community minded,	no	25
27002:15	i've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy *t*-1	no	12
27081:6	some of them were even better behaved.	yes	7
27173:11	and consequently some of the very best students were, had excellent memories	yes	12
27358:66	i remembering *-2 reading a few cases about that when it, when some people first tried that *t*-1	no	18
27515:40	and, uh, and, in fact she put some right ba-,	no	10
27536:16	and then they wanted some gray * to do the, *-1 to do the trim.	no	15
27714:77	but the, the interesting thing is 0 that paint we wound up *-1 having *-2 to go back and scrape some of that away	yes	24
27784:137	i think 0 with, in a way one could talk about simon and garfunkel that way because they do tend, uh, *-1 to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, uh, usually tend *-2 to have some good or bad moral to it.	no	45
27803:14	i listen to some country and western	no	7
27810:100	but when i do play, uh, and begin *-4 to reacquire skills *t*-5 i inevitably fall in love with country western music which *t*-1 tends *-2 to be in some ways easy 0 * to play *t*-3 for a, for a new piano player.	no	44
27827:8	for some reason there's, there's not a whole lot of his stuff that i'm real crazy about *t*-5,	no	21
27828:16	but he does have some things.	no	6
27829:11	chicago had some things,	no	4
27833:47	uh, and i think 0 even electric light orchestra had some, some real, um, influences by classical music	no	18
27838:29	i find it *exp*-2 very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy *t*-1 i particularly like the music.	no	19
27895:38	i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes *t*-1	yes	16
27940:52	i just, you know, i can just drift off into some other world *-3 just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time 0 * to do that *t*-2,	no	32
28139:163	because if, if i had been allowed *-1 to work, you know, maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week, i might still be working basically full time or part time, if there was, if there had been some way 0 *-3 to work it out *t*-2,	no	50
28305:5	some kids are really having it.	no	6
28311:20	un, you know some time day care is really good,	no	10
28366:25	some of the, some of the women's roles, i think 0 *t*-2, are almost for the worse, because we're losing out on some things, *-1 going back to work,	yes	31
28366:97	some of the, some of the women's roles, i think 0 *t*-2, are almost for the worse, because we're losing out on some things, *-1 going back to work,	no	31
28617:29	and we, uh, got a quote on some laser printers *ich*-1 the other day at six hundred dollars.	no	18
28732:27	and the guys that, some of the guys that *t*-1 run this place are very tight	yes	16
28754:51	i used *-1 to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until i had some knee surgery last fall.	no	21
29195:22	they need *-1 to put some sternness back into the, into the teachers and let them be able *-2 to, uh, get the old whip out and get some discipline.	no	30
29195:103	they need *-1 to put some sternness back into the, into the teachers and let them be able *-2 to, uh, get the old whip out and get some discipline.	no	30
29198:51	then it comes down to what you said *t*-1 before though about them being some of the lowest paid public, you know, public service, employees that there are *t*-2,	yes	29
29226:97	goodness gracious, if we would, uh, plan our expressways a little better, that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads, we'd cut that in half and get some teachers	no	31
29245:55	i, uh, i think 0 we both agree 0 there's some problems there	no	14
29320:36	so here lately with all the middle eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.	no	18
29366:36	and they go back and forth, where everyone's giving some opinions *t*-1	no	13
29390:27	and, and they shed some light on what *t*-1 was going on for me.	no	14
29395:70	um, it, it, it *exp*-3 was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe 0 * to grind *t*-1, you know,	yes	26
29396:12	there were some that *t*-1 were screaming for air power,	no	10
29397:12	there were some that *t*-1 were saying 0 the air power wasn't going *-2 to do it.	no	18
29555:18	and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of *t*-1.	no	15
29611:26	people say * let me see some of your work.	yes	10
29649:11	i did some needlepoint years ago,	no	6
29748:14	i've seen some,	no	4
29772:26	there's bound *-1 to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that *t*-2's very similar that *t*-3's not going *-4 to melt too much with, uh, uh, high humidity, in a room,	no	36
29936:8	but some things, especially letters, if they suggest certain colors for letters, i just go with whatever i want *-1 to *?* *t*-2.	no	24
30053:200	i know 0 when i travel *t*-1, or when i used *-2 to travel overseas quite a bit *t*-3, what i would do *t*-4 on my american express card is before i would, before i left i would mail a check to, to american express and, you know, have some idea of how much *t*-5 was there, you know,	no	59
30223:41	i, i've been doing it for twenty some odd years.	no	11
30326:27	we have, you know, used some of it for some personal things.	yes	12
30326:39	we have, you know, used some of it for some personal things.	no	12
30363:74	then, you know, then, we thought, well we can use it for, you know, some personal things.	no	17
30373:28	and, you know, it's got some stuff on it.	no	10
30374:49	it's got a nice little word processing software on it, you know, and some budgeting type things and stuff.	no	20
30428:39	there are some definitely, some, some advantages to it.	no	9
30439:14	and we have some education programs that he likes *t*-1.	no	10
30532:36	i mean, and then of course you have some changes 0 * to make *t*-1, and do the whole thing over.	no	21
30614:74	so. anyway, maybe, you know, maybe it'll, it'll help in some way,	no	14
30622:38	well, i would like *-1 to get one at home some day.	no	12
30624:22	and so, you know, some day i would like *-1 to get, even just like the video tell, or something like that, you know,	no	24
30750:94	he was, he's of course, uh, i guess 0 he's trained in this, uh, martial arts of some sort,	no	21
30806:60	it was really, i mean the hollywood really must think 0 there's some real dummies out there or something.	no	20
30921:13	but they changed some things in the movie.	no	8
30973:38	but he, he gets involved *-1 in some sort of bad dealings with somebody	no	14
31014:9	in some of those, you know, they, i guess they retitled some movies that *t*-1 were going *-2 to be about lebanese and, and, you know, and, and americans	yes	29
31014:60	in some of those, you know, they, i guess they retitled some movies that *t*-1 were going *-2 to be about lebanese and, and, you know, and, and americans	no	29
31115:59	and, uh, you know, i, i've, in hindsight, seen some things that i wished that, you know, i had done something about *t*-1 that *t*-3 was, you know, within my power or, uh, you know, wish that in some ways we, as parents, had more control over what *t*-2's happening up there, you know, type thing.	no	58
31115:171	and, uh, you know, i, i've, in hindsight, seen some things that i wished that, you know, i had done something about *t*-1 that *t*-3 was, you know, within my power or, uh, you know, wish that in some ways we, as parents, had more control over what *t*-2's happening up there, you know, type thing.	no	58
31131:48	but, uh, still i, i questioned the ability of some of the teachers * to, uh, really do a bang-up job,	yes	21
31191:38	and i would imagine 0 their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases.	no	14
31208:111	are the rest of us who *t*-1 went for the big bucks, you know, staying out of, you know, where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated *-2 to spend some time *-4 teaching or something with these kids *t*-3?	no	41
31215:25	maybe there need *-1 to be some radical changes made *.	no	11
31216:12	* do some things that *t*-1 are totally different and unheard of.	no	12
31255:86	and while it had, you know, a few little grammatical problems, it wasn't very long and so forth. i thought 0 it had some nice, well thought out, uh, parts to it.	no	33
31414:30	i agree that, that some innocent person might be victimized *-1, by a false test,	no	15
31418:40	but i would think that, um, that some guidelines could be set *-1 up * to avoid that.	no	18
31427:43	on the other hand, um, i think 0 there's certainly some professions that *t*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because of the, of their responsibility for the public welfare, and certainly people in, uh, industries, well, the transportation industry, for spe-, uh, you know, specifically.	no	47
31471:13	and it takes some drastic steps at this point.	no	9
31560:36	and there needs *-1 to be some, some measure of, uh, certainty before anything drastic happens.	no	16
31577:86	so it seems to me that, that, um, there needs *-1 to be some ground, you know, some rules that *t*-2 protect.	no	22
31604:11	would be some measure of protection.	no	6
31611:69	well, there's, yeah, there, there's going *-1 to be some measure of incentive, uh, reward or whatever,	no	19

34037:123	because if, if you're going *-1 to go *-2 buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, i think 0 you, you're going *-3 to have some idea as to what you're going *-4 to do *t*-5 with it.	no	41
34113:39	you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition.	no	18
34184:41	but, uh, i think 0 there ought *-1 to be some rule against it.	no	14
34289:33	i can, i can buy some, uh, today if i wanted *-1 to *?*.	no	15
34467:48	but it was on a higher level, you know, where there were some things that kids didn't understand *t*-1 that adults did *t*-2 *t*-3,	no	25
34581:32	and there were, there were some definite, um, should i say *rnr*-1, tense moments, with him in there.	no	18
34829:125	see, that's the one, that is the honest to god the one reason 0 i don't want *-1 to see the movie *t*-2 is because i love buffalos for some weird reason,	no	34

35642:46	and so she's going *-1 to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try *-2 to make as much down payment as possible *-2 to keep the monthly payment low.	no	38
35921:146	i mean, i've always felt that people on welfare should be required *-1 to spend at least part of their time, not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity * to look for a job, but at least some of their time * to look for, *-2 to go out and clean up the roads. you know,	yes	61
36032:51	i think, i think 0 there ought *-1 to be some kind of assistance as far as, uh,	no	18

37585:99	it seems that what you really need *-1 to do *t*-2 *-3 to win though, is * to have a team that *t*-4 has reasonable talent and has some people that *t*-5 have, have, have real breakthrough years.	no	38
37736:14	'cause i did some teaching part-time	no	6
37766:94	what *t*-1 gets me is 0 i can't believe that congress, uh, or, our state legislature can't come up with, uh, some kind of workable means 0 * to have funds for the school *t*-2.	no	37

38546:39	but that has a little bit 0 *t*-1 to do with some of the things that i read *t*-2.	yes	19
38557:11	right now some of the things 0 i'm working with *t*-1 are kids that *t*-2 are dealing with sexual abuse,	yes	21

48360:26	but i guess 0 it would be some.	no	8
48518:19	once you get into some of the programs that *t*-1 are out now, you can do so much *ich*-3 with them, that you don't do *t*-2 until you really make yourself use them.	yes	34

50452:133	you know, we, we've got folks running around here who *t*-1 get, who *t*-2 get degrees in basket weaving and you know, underwater psychology, or some, some ridiculous stuff like that.	no	32
50686:55	but there are an awful lot of young people who *t*-1 would benefit from, um, some sort of public service, like the conservation corps back in the thirties or, uh, various other things of that sort.	no	36
50704:33	it *exp*-3 would be great * to have some of those organizations like 0 you mentioned *t*-1 that *t*-2 were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids.	yes	32
50705:24	and i think 0 there are some available now where they are able *-1 to work *t*-2,	no	17
50717:7	and some people would get military service	no	7
50718:7	and some people would get civilian, uh, service, like * working in hospitals.	no	13
50775:30	and then you have *-1 to pay them some kind of a stipend,	no	13
50845:44	um, well, like i say, i know that there are some type of programs that they have *t*-1 available for a youth, like teenagers to go and do, um, work in the national parks and work in, uh, neighborhoods *-2 to do, um, clean up and that sort of thing.	no	50
51230:48	i mean, the guy's twenty, twenty-five home rums, maybe thirty, eighty some r b i-s.	no	16
51336:82	you know, i kind of wish that they had inter league play, like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the national league teams here once in a while.	yes	35
51558:12	they had some other expenses that *t*-1 came up	no	9
51578:33	and, um, it had been recommended *-1 by some friends of ours	no	12
51684:29	i mean, he has always got some kind of, cold or something.	no	12
51752:21	and, and some kid goes out and gets the kid	no	10

52077:5	some, i guess like,	no	4
52128:61	now, i, i also liked, uh, oh, gone with the wind or some of the classic, like the lawrence of arabia.	yes	21
52288:14	i mean some of them are done *-1 good	yes	9
52640:64	and * having sat on both, uh, uh, criminal *rnr*-1 and a civil *rnr*-1, uh, jury, some of what *t*-2 goes through our courts is a total waste of time.	yes	30
52655:41	i would like *-1 to see some, some kind of reform, or some kind of streamlining so that, if a person is, um, convicted *-2, and sentenced *-2 to, to death, that that automatic appeal which *t*-3 goes in could be more quickly dealt with *-4.	no	46
52655:63	i would like *-1 to see some, some kind of reform, or some kind of streamlining so that, if a person is, um, convicted *-2, and sentenced *-2 to, to death, that that automatic appeal which *t*-3 goes in could be more quickly dealt with *-4.	no	46
52990:22	i know 0 there are some good places 0 * to go *-2 camping *t*-1 along the, uh, the lakes.	no	20
53230:88	i, uh, i left t i in january *-1 hoping *-2 to strike out and find a job where i could make some money *t*-3.	no	25
53395:29	i, sometimes i hear some things on, on the radio.	no	10
53606:11	we got some awful rain, uh, the other morning.	no	9
53610:10	uh, some real massive thunderstorms.	no	5
53614:59	apparently, i, i don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too.	no	21
53618:11	* caused some damage.	no	4
53622:14	we may get some more tonight.	no	6
53634:14	we're getting some flooding.	no	5
53697:15	you've got some kids that *t*-1'll pick up on it in the first three minutes 0 you're talking about it *t*-2,	no	24
53722:5	some are really going *-1 to be heavy into reading.	no	10
53859:39	instead of, there has *-1 to be some sort of discipline,	no	11
53860:24	and there has *-1 to be some sort of punishment. short of * physically isolating the child, and short of * physically hitting the child.	no	25
53921:15	i mean, some kids don't get don't get spanked *-1 at home	no	14
53922:7	and some kids need *-1 to be spanked *-2 at home.	no	11
54010:82	i, i guess 0 mostly as far as, as crafts go, i've done, um, some needlepoint.	no	17
54025:19	just when i get some spare time here and there *t*-1 i'll work on it,	no	16
54082:30	and during the week they go back and do some more.	no	11
54381:12	there are some kurds living in iran.	no	7
54385:32	and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid.	no	13
54472:148	i keep, you know, um, you know, there's like three movies that i, i keep *-1 telling myself that i should see *t*-2 one of these, you know, some day that i haven't seen *t*-3, you know, that, that *t*-5 are classics, you know.	no	46
54518:41	there's, there is, you know some blood and everything	no	10
54648:44	when you think of what it takes *t*-1 * to make some of those kind of movies *t*-2, you know.	yes	20
54847:12	how about some of the ads,	yes	6
54872:38	so, we're probably going *-1 to like rent those some time and then try *-2 to see godfather part three somewhere.	no	22
55034:11	uh, some of them didn't	yes	6
55084:23	in a way aikman has done some of that.	yes	9
55126:16	boy, they'd some big changes, * speaking of them.	no	10
55165:39	uh, marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes, because of some of the stupid stuff 0 he does *t*-1,	yes	19
55224:111	and my reasons are based *-1 upon not only from what i read *t*-2 in the newspapers, what i see *t*-3 on the newspapers, but up against some of the, fun and exciting things 0 i ran into *t*-4 during my six years as a soldier in the fifth special forces group.	yes	52
55289:86	there's probably five or six, which *t*-1 would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that *t*-2 are in positions over some of these soviet states.	yes	29
55316:28	but on a highly populated area, like some of the soviet cities would be *?*, with the weaponry that *t*-1's attached *-2 on those things, there is no place 0 * to hide *t*-3.	yes	36
55334:34	but, during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, i mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff?	no	23
55391:26	and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself.	yes	13
55897:52	uh, and i find ways 0 *-1 to, to turn some of that back to, to others *t*-2.	yes	18
55924:11	it gave some folks some jobs,	no	6
55924:16	it gave some folks some jobs,	no	6
55925:13	and we got some great public works out of it.	no	10
55938:34	and this would give them a chance *-1 to have some positive self-esteem.	no	13
55952:54	you take pride in that, and, and get some, some positive feedback from those *ich*-2 who *t*-1 benefit, besides yourself.	no	20
56008:41	and i can see, you know, some, some really significant things coming out of it.	no	15
56059:56	and i thought 0 i had seen, when we were traveling around the state *t*-1, some similar signs *ich*-2 up that *t*-3 indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up *-4	no	33
56078:32	and they, they've started some recycling campaigns that *t*-1 a year before that had been turned down *-2 because they said, well, it's not feasible,	no	27
56108:55	but, it *exp*-1 is comforting to me * to see, uh, more concern about some of these things that, that *t*-2 cost us money.	yes	24
56116:70	it *exp*-1's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may, may, make some people realize that hey, you know, this stuff runs out.	no	28
56139:87	uh, or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say, oh, my goodness, now we don't have the ability * to go on to some new technology.	no	29
56204:26	and you put a bay leaf and put some, uh, red pepper over it.	no	14
56209:19	or you can just get some, you know, regular red peppers.	no	11
56322:79	and while that's cooking, i take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,	no	22
56324:16	and i shred up some just regular white cheese.	no	9
56381:43	and, uh, usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up, and put some color into it, you know,	no	18
56423:26	oh. you ought *-1 to try some crawfish.	no	8
56665:84	um, you don't even have *-1 to go all the way to new orleans, you know, if you want *-2 to really get some good food.	no	27
56692:21	and, uh, i have some friends that *t*-1 live down there.	no	11
56817:32	and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them	yes	13
56850:10	uh, some countries voting is obligatory.	no	6
56905:7	and some people don't vote,	no	6
56910:20	but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote.	no	14
57078:62	and, uh, he makes a very, uh, passionate, good argument for why you don't want some things decided *-1 by democratic process *t*-2,	no	24
57082:16	if there's some minority that people don't like *t*-1 because of, you know, racial hatred or something like that, the majority can just simply vote again-, vote against them.	no	31
57196:74	i believe 0 at i b m they, they make 0 you wear a blue suit and, uh, some kind of colored shirt and a tie.	no	26
57215:41	and he'll be over there until july first *-1 setting up some kind of computers for them.	no	18
57412:48	it had, uh, leather, leather designs and, um, some other, other little things on it	no	15
57469:14	and that was some time ago,	no	6
57651:111	i'm convinced that, uh, detroit or whoever it is *t*-1 made a major mistake, years ago when they stopped *-2 putting the small v eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes *t*-3.	yes	38
57659:64	i'm convinced that the small v eight like the, the mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the chevy two eighty-threes, were good little v eight engines that *t*-1 were not gas guzzlers	yes	35
57863:29	um, * looking back, like maybe some of the things that i know *t*-1 now, i, i'm not sure 0 i do believe 0 it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.	yes	34
57999:88	i-, if they could just cut out all the fat and, and get it lean, and start *-1 addressing some of the other issues, i think 0 *t*-2 we could take care of everything. and quit *-3 taking care of all these other countries all across the world, you know, who *t*-4 just end up *-5 using things against us later on anyway.	yes	63
58112:22	and som-, for some reason those people don't see that.	no	11
58286:70	and america does have a long history of * sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting, you know, some other model.	no	24
58412:16	um, i do some every now and then,	no	8
58705:6	some of the stuff is good,	yes	6
58814:28	ye-, you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else	yes	14
59322:11	and then some of the bigger companies,	yes	7
59429:38	and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems.	no	14
59675:12	he had some cocaine and th-, it was accused *-1 of * selling it,	no	14
59733:43	i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change, you know.	yes	19
59814:135	and then we'll have all, we'll have, we will have the money if we would do that * to, to work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here	no	35
60112:20	my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think 0 he's outgrown *t*-1 now,	no	16
60149:37	i could see some *-1 having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that *t*-2 are really, really pretty	no	18
60478:27	and, and that has some opportunities	no	6
60705:37	and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid *-1 off between now and then.	no	26
60738:38	on channel thirteen, uh, they had some, some programs the day before,	no	12
60768:31	but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the, um, what they do *t*-1, uh, *-2 to, uh, make their dough and st-, to, clean out the flour and stuff like that,	yes	35
60778:8	and some of the people that *t*-1 work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming *t*-2 they, you know, shut down everything and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're, that they're dumping things, that they're not supposed *-1 to be dumping *t*-2,	yes	54
60864:47	so, i don't see, you know, how they can do some of the te- *t*-1,	yes	16
60986:35	and the, the ground will filter some of it but not all of it.	yes	14
61316:40	we, we were trying *-1 to find some pictures of him recently.	no	12
61530:74	so, uh, we got, we, we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it, you know, so that he couldn't get out.	no	28
61624:25	and we named him buddy beaner for some reason.	no	9
61694:30	and also i'm interested in * writing some programs that *t*-1 will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that wednesdays is trash day and the like.	no	31
61878:40	and just recently i've changed my job * to actually do some of the marketing.	yes	16
61968:36	but i've, i've got some opinions on it.	no	10
61995:5	some type of college, uh, volunteer work for teachers, that *t*-1 they are straight out of college	no	17
62026:5	some group paid part of his college income	no	8
62048:41	you know, if, if we had some really major health problem that *t*-1 required a specialist, we could find one	no	20
62145:60	but say, i think 0 bangladesh *ich*-1 would have been a good example or some, some really desperate situation	no	19
62211:96	and maybe rather than * just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, * maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states *t*-2.	no	59
62211:137	and maybe rather than * just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, * maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states *t*-2.	no	59
62215:25	but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.	no	10
62280:63	so, we're a little fa-, you know, farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing *t*-1.	yes	32
62302:24	so, we'll talk about that some.	no	7
62358:56	well, we bought a computer because my husband needed *-1 to use it * to do some work for a consulting project,	no	22
62424:8	in some ways it has more *-2 to do with the people who *t*-1 sold it.	no	16
62467:51	and they say 0 they can, you know, do something different and change some connectors	no	15
62484:17	so, well, actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card	no	19
62494:82	but that's one thing 0 *t*-2 to be said *-1 for credit. it, how, it gets you some muscle where you need it *t*-1 *t*-3.	no	26
62544:33	but * to keep her entertained, music and some of these things do help.	yes	14
62548:100	and i thought well, if i had, uh, a nic-, a nice little, um, tape recorder, you know, so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while. and then also so that i can, uh, uh, copy, uh, parts off, i, i do some musicals and things like this and if i can copy sections off that 0 i can use *t*-1 someplace so i figured well this will be good.	no	80
62594:19	do you buy it at some major store?	no	8
62849:29	and then i was having *-1 to work some real late hours *-1 to get caught with my work after i got out of class.	no	25
62853:41	and then i went to colorado springs the next week *-1 to do some training at the t i up there.	no	21
62885:8	and some of them require me to go out of town,	yes	11
62998:35	um, it's a lot more fun than some other things 0 i could do *t*-1, i guess 0 *t*-2.	no	20
63163:19	uh, they have some during, during lunch hour that *t*-1 are shorter,	no	12
63174:15	they even have some late night ones for people that *t*-1 work second shift and things like that.	no	18
63176:14	they even have some, uh, aerobic, uh, water aerobics when the weather gets nice *t*-1 out in the pool.	no	19
63193:46	and i think 0 they're working on *-1 building a jogging track and some other things.	no	17
63260:17	and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter.	no	21
63319:95	i would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age, you know, under the age of thirty or so, to have some idea what it is *t*-1, anyway.	no	31
63382:11	and then some of them are done *-1 in, you know, purely metric.	yes	13
63481:24	now, okay, we run into some problems once,	no	8
63581:7	and some are in kilometers.	no	5
63593:18	and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, um, plastic, um, i think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatev-, whatever other combination there is *t*-1.	no	30
63596:63	and, and i think 0 they've got a comp-, uh, some kind of container for aluminum.	no	17
63690:51	and i think 0 they're trying *-1 to, to make some changes.	no	13
63740:30	i, i wonder about some of the prod-, products that they don't take *t*-1, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take *t*-2. uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those *t*-3.	yes	40
63740:81	i, i wonder about some of the prod-, products that they don't take *t*-1, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take *t*-2. uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those *t*-3.	yes	40
64077:19	the other day we had some hail, the biggest hail 0 i've ever seen *t*-1 in texas.	no	18
64249:28	but if i were *-1 to live some place else, it certainly meets my standards.	no	15
64345:11	they have some pretty nice weather out there in los angeles.	no	11
64391:18	and they've built some new highways out to that area, and things, lately.	no	14
64749:24	and i hope 0 you get some more calls and make some more calls.	no	14
64749:36	and i hope 0 you get some more calls and make some more calls.	no	14
65044:48	and i hope 0 we, hope 0 we did them some good, uh, on their little computer dealy.	no	18
65143:6	some of those books are real tough 0 * to get into *t*-1,	yes	13
65240:13	does he get some royalties from that, hopefully?	no	8
65456:58	it's, uh, something 0 we're really irritated about *t*-1 around here. or some people are really irritated about *t*-1.	no	21
65698:44	i would like *-1 to be a little more into * investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems. and * to come up with something a little better than what we've got *t*-2.	yes	40
65715:56	but i'm just saying that even the differences, uh, is that, you know, some countries pay for students to go to, through college and etcetera.	no	26
65777:13	so we had some interference,	no	5
65787:148	but, uh, you know, i think, 0 uh, they, maybe they need *-2 to, uh, help *-3 promote that more. give incentives like, uh, if they do bring somebody on, they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is *t*-1, you know, for them to train people, you know, stuff like that.	yes	58
65796:26	but see, that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people. at people, per, at high school level, which i would like *-1 to see *t*-2. rather than so many kids getting out of school.	yes	45
65921:58	i, uh, i'm trying my best right now *-1 to pay off some of mine.	yes	16
65926:36	and, uh, but still i have some that *t*-1 are, are up to the limit.	no	15
66268:27	what *t*-1's amazing is 0 some of them have been on death row for a number of years.	yes	19
66485:14	you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on * convicting him on some of the charges	no	21
66485:70	you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on * convicting him on some of the charges	yes	21
66542:24	there are some, some other crimes that i think, uh, you know, uh,	no	13
66548:15	but, um, some of these people are just out and out brutal.	yes	12
66801:49	and some, some of the people, uh, some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too, are picking up some of those great big houses,	yes	26
66801:91	and some, some of the people, uh, some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too, are picking up some of those great big houses,	yes	26
67032:120	uh, so i've been doing that less, and, and concentrating more on, you know, light biking when i get home on the evening *t*-1 and then, you know, some more on the weekends.	no	34
67105:22	they want *-1 to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour.	no	15
67419:50	and the dog was being house sit *-1, or dog sit *-1, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,	no	21
67588:39	well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the,	yes	15
67788:18	you know for quite some time, just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty.	no	19
67910:51	but they, they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason.	no	14
68296:20	but, if there are some people who *t*-1 don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems *-2 to be 0 there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.	no	33
68296:115	but, if there are some people who *t*-1 don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems *-2 to be 0 there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.	no	33
68395:46	i, i have, i have some friends who *t*-1 do expert wis-, witness testimony	no	14
68398:112	and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that *t*-1 was, uh, you know, har-, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corp-, corporation.	no	39
69048:36	oh, there's, there's some nice things in baltimore, you know,	no	12
69235:82	well, i guess 0 that's one of the positive things that *t*-1 ha-, have come out of it, some of the employee assistance program.	yes	25
69317:12	they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests.	no	10
69318:15	they've mumblex some companies that *t*-1 are doing, uh, hair tests.	no	12
69325:53	and they can apparently test, um, back a certain period of time. because mumblex some of the, the residue ends up in your hair follicles, you know,	yes	27
69394:38	so you ha-, you have been to some family reunions, perhaps.	no	11
69436:31	and, uh, you know, there's some my age	no	9
69437:19	and then there are some a lot younger, an, about four generations, i guess 0 *t*-1.	no	16
69702:22	well at least you've got some.	no	7
69752:23	and, uh, there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way.	no	14
69766:19	at least y'all are getting some rain up in dallas.	no	10
69843:19	well, we could use some rain up here.	no	8
69930:11	we get some when it's this rainy *t*-1,	no	9
69961:8	for some reason, because of the cold, uh, ocean, uh, water, the air is always cool.	no	16
70000:26	and, they have, of course, some pretty severe storms, winter storms, snow and that type of thing.	no	17
70044:20	maybe we can send you some.	no	6
70254:23	* living in the city has some advantages.	no	8
70312:15	i've got some onions *ich*-1 out, tomatoes,	no	8
70345:19	well, i've done some rewiring on it.	no	8
70492:35	and, uh, so, we had *-1 to make some adjustments	no	10
70615:79	so. but, um, that's the hardest part for us is that it's really, um, you know, budgeting and some extra things, you know, for-, that *t*-1 are more, you know, nonessential items.	no	34
70687:44	well, uh, but i do realize that, that is realistic for some people,	no	13
70801:79	i, i don't know what amount of, what amount of, our hardware *t*-1 would stop some fanatic, i guess, from *-2 doing anything, uh, that *t*-3 would be irrational.	no	30
70825:88	so tho-, those are two areas in which t i stands *-1 to, to gain some, some short term business 0 *t*-2 to restock that *t*-3.	no	26
70842:55	uh, i kn-, i'm familiar with some, some upbeat school areas,	no	12
70863:36	* to g-, to give you some perspective, this, this town that i had lived in *t*-1 for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded *-2 sixty-five per cent by state funds.	no	31
70903:134	uh, i, uh, i, i do, i, i guess 0 i am a s-, uh, a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education.	no	28
70928:33	at least what i read *t*-1, is that some younger people feel that education is priced *-2 out of their, uh, out of their, uh, budget.	no	26
70962:5	some states they pay, uh,	no	5
70963:38	in germany or in, in england in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay up to six-, fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes.	no	31
70968:40	now it costs me money *-2 to leave the country, some sort of a tax to leave the country, some sort of an airport departure tax, uh, uh, a tax, a sales tax which *t*-3 is getting to, uh, quite high levels,	no	42
70968:68	now it costs me money *-2 to leave the country, some sort of a tax to leave the country, some sort of an airport departure tax, uh, uh, a tax, a sales tax which *t*-3 is getting to, uh, quite high levels,	no	42
71062:32	and i can still do some, some sorts of things	no	10
71180:48	in fact, i was going *-1 to go out today *-2 to buy some plants so i could put them in,	no	21
71240:27	and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs,,	no	11
71562:15	because i work some weird hours and do some traveling.	no	10
71562:27	because i work some weird hours and do some traveling.	no	10
71710:23	i think 0 my wife has some.	no	7
71718:14	or sand even some of them,	yes	6
71724:14	and there's some that, like the different colors denotes how much they, how much the tension i guess they are *t*-4 and how easy *ich*-3 they are *t*-1 0 * to move *t*-2 *t*-5.	no	35
71729:8	and some of them are real short	yes	7
71767:38	the, uh, the, some of the nautilus equipment that i started *-1 seeing *t*-2 at the one that we used *-3 to go to *t*-4 was really interesting,	yes	28
71799:29	just * to do, you know, some bicep, tricep exercises.	no	10
72026:14	and i see some of the problems 0 the kids have *t*-1 when they don't have a real good family structure *t*-2.	yes	23
72059:96	there are a lot of jobs that *t*-1 are coming about, like in computers at home, and those types of things, that *t*-2 would at least in some ways, um, bridge the gap.	no	33
72127:44	but we may have *-1 to give up on some, some things.	no	12
72192:42	i wish 0 i had *?* in, in some senses	no	11
72201:8	for some reason it seems *-1 to interest me, like people that *t*-2 make a big comeback or, you know, orel hershiser, things like that.	no	25
72217:16	but they usually have some good articles in it.	no	9
72471:15	there may be some schools 0 you could read about *t*-1 and learn.	no	13
72672:51	because my sister worked at the, uh, the visa some bank americard center there.	no	14
72758:10	and for some strange reason those people think 0 they need *-1 to get paid *-2.	no	16
72778:11	and then some of them add late fees on it, if they don't get paid *-1	yes	17
72811:70	so, they've got quite a bit more motivation i think 0 *t*-3 * to get paid *-2 then, some of the others do.	yes	24
72861:67	i've got three card offers *ich*-1 now, uh, from gas companies and, uh, visa gold and, uh, some,, other bank, uh,	no	22
73129:26	and, uh, when i seen some of my friends that *t*-1 have taken that six week old baby, you know, to someone else *t*-2, it's just, i can imagine how emotional it must be *t*-3.	yes	36
73176:40	i think 0 that might be part of the problem with some people. you know,	no	15
73395:88	people are being a little more, oh, i don't know, a little le-, a little less bigoted in some ways,	no	21
73543:7	at some point	no	3
73672:17	well, i got some friends that, uh,	no	7
73794:6	some of these are urban worries	yes	6
73808:17	we've been having some problem now	no	7
73873:46	i think 0 the other thing is that, uh, we have taken some rather drastic turns in our, in our education and the way 0 we approach things *t*-1 as of maybe starting back when, when i'm number one, you know, and, uh, uh, uh, * worrying about self and not, uh, seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *t*-2.	no	63
73883:21	if you don't have some kind of, of basic believe or something down inside of you, then it *exp*-1's very difficult * to, uh, have anything 0 * to turn to *t*-2, when you got, when you've got something facing you like that *t*-3.	no	47
73940:12	i see some flickers of, of, uh, of good directions turning,	no	11
73963:9	and, some people just don't have it.	no	8
73981:5	some ways it's rather frightening,	no	6
74180:13	so i have some rather strong opinions.	no	7
74203:84	and then i would provide, uh, use the money that we've paying them *t*-1 *-4 to, uh, provide some special help in training and particularly, uh, mentor teachers 0 *t*-2 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who *t*-3 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time.	no	61
74211:24	and then * let them try some innovative things and see what *t*-2 works. and then, uh, have some sort of mechanism for * passing that knowledge along to other teachers who *t*-1 could benefit from the same sorts of things. and then from the parents' side, have the parents support the school. get involved.	no	56
74211:65	and then * let them try some innovative things and see what *t*-2 works. and then, uh, have some sort of mechanism for * passing that knowledge along to other teachers who *t*-1 could benefit from the same sorts of things. and then from the parents' side, have the parents support the school. get involved.	no	56
74223:18	that's, uh, some pretty good ideas.	no	7
74251:93	but, uh, that was, that's the extent of which i guess 0 that's more than, than some people, less than others.	no	23
74280:27	so we'd have *-1 to have some way 0 * to, uh, reward and recognize the teachers who *t*-2 are doing a good job and give them a, a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money *t*-3.	no	43
74280:130	so we'd have *-1 to have some way 0 * to, uh, reward and recognize the teachers who *t*-2 are doing a good job and give them a, a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money *t*-3.	no	43
74294:25	you know, if there's some gauge that they could make *t*-1.	no	12
74301:8	but some certain type of, of position where you're overseen *-1 *t*-2 * to begin with.	no	17
74315:52	at least what i used *-2 to observe *t*-3 in student teaching, was that some college kid who *t*-1 might not be all that bright * to begin with, was thrown *-7 into a class room with a teacher who *t*-4 was harried and overworked and, uh, had too many kids 0 * to handle *t*-5 and too many things 0 * to do *t*-6 and too many interruptions * to pay much attention to the student teacher.	no	78
74360:60	well, another thing 0 i think 0 *t*-1 would be helpful would be * to have some sort of, of say a national curriculum. because one of the problems with * getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for, uh, curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that *t*-2 will sell in texas and california.	no	60
74404:174	and i hope 0 maybe we're going *-1 to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid *-2 to it with, uh, reagan's, uh, new education secretary and, uh, you know, trying * to do some, uh, trying *-3 to produce some new programs anyway.	no	48
74443:58	i measured it one time, because i was, uh, we had saw some termites	no	14
74598:33	it's, it's seen some wear and tear. you know.	no	11
74663:29	i mean we need *-1 to redo some, rewiring ourselves	no	10
74843:21	the fire alarm went off for some reason.	no	8
74914:42	it's, it's been done for quite some time.	no	10
75188:116	it's kind of scary when i think of what *t*-2 will happen in twenty years, you know, when i have kids and they're grown *t*-3 and, uh, just kind of some of the changes that *t*-1 will happen even more *t*-4	yes	43
75207:8	and some of the other ones weren't born.	yes	9
75332:25	and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms uh, and including the out, uh, the outer perimeter type, uh, devices, sensors and things like that.	no	35
75584:44	you can, you know, you can get some of us,	yes	10
75795:23	and so, i think 0 some of the things that i did *t*-1 paid off.	yes	15
75835:19	they, uh, auctioned some tools and, things like that,	no	9
75846:57	and, so, well, i thought, gee, i've been wanting *-1 to, do some brick, uh, walkways for a time.	no	20
75858:22	anyway, it ended up after some pretty, uh, heavy bidding, that i got all those bricks for forty dollars.	no	19
75948:31	i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something un-, on, on top of the sand and then lay the bricks.	no	28
75961:15	i did get some material and studied every bit of material that i could study *t*-1,	no	16
76012:37	if they have problems with, uh, sand bugs of some kind i think 0 *t*-3 all 0 they need *t*-1 to do *t*-4 is probably *-2 put some insecticide down in there on a, oh, a fairly regular basis, for a while anyway.	no	43
76012:96	if they have problems with, uh, sand bugs of some kind i think 0 *t*-3 all 0 they need *t*-1 to do *t*-4 is probably *-2 put some insecticide down in there on a, oh, a fairly regular basis, for a while anyway.	no	43
76157:23	if, uh, you've some kid who *t*-2 doesn't have, uh, who *t*-1's from a broken family, the schools are supposed *-3 to fill that void.	no	28
76252:42	and, uh, there really needs *-1 to be a bridge, some sort of transition for that.	no	16
76424:28	i mean, you know, at some point a parent does help their kid, but in, in some ways,	no	18
76424:81	i mean, you know, at some point a parent does help their kid, but in, in some ways,	no	18
76448:61	it *exp*-3's amazing how the, you know, people 0 you talk to *t*-1 have some interesting conversations *t*-2	no	19
76676:15	but, uh, some of,	yes	4
76907:7	and some people said to me," well, that's our wintertime."	no	11
76952:28	what do you think 0 *t*-1 are some current trends in, uh, the way 0 families spend time together *t*-2, based on what you've seen *t*-3.	no	27
77001:21	and, um, * did some shopping and stuff.	no	8
77041:6	some of the people that i work with *t*-1 they, like when i worked on second shift *t*-2, um, their paren-, their kids go to school during the day	yes	29
77104:31	what's, what are some other questions 0 they have *t*-1 *t*-2,	no	12
77235:16	what *t*-1 are some of the things that you did *t*-2 with your children when they were growing up *t*-3?	yes	20
77401:34	but i think 0 it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours.	yes	21
77443:88	and you want *-1 to be avail-, at least i've wanted *-2 to be available, when they, for some reason, they had, they were bouncing something off of me *t*-3. because it was something that *t*-4 was bothering them or they were concerned about *t*-4,	no	46
77485:16	every weekend there was some visiting somewhere.	no	7
77529:18	and so the kids in some ways are, are, are suffering a little bit, in that, uh, the model, the role models that *t*-2 get the, the, the family issues that *t*-1 get discussed *t*-1, and all these, i think 0 *t*-3 are very important parts of them growing up,	no	50
77548:48	but, uh, i-, it seems that there should be some continuity,	no	11
77740:20	and you could always find some channel that *t*-1 had something on	no	12
77853:41	and i know 0 they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas,	yes	17
77935:15	they've had some terrible problems with hispanics,	no	8
78035:34	i've become very aware of different political views because some of the things 0 we have *-1 to discuss *t*-2 are very politically motivated or whatever,	yes	27
78207:46	if, if, if there was some place that, that we went to *t*-2 where there was hiking involved * *t*-3, i, i would be you know, happy * to go *-1 hiking,	no	32
78230:8	so some of the things are not as, quite as, uh, adaptable.	yes	12
78259:112	i know that, uh, uh, one of, one thing that *t*-1 happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family.	yes	32
78409:26	but, even, even some little ones do pretty good	no	9
78638:15	if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and,	no	15
78677:35	they have *-1 to kind of take a stand on some things, like abortion and things like that,	no	18
79001:12	they had some bends *ich*-1, around that we could find and put them in *t*-2	no	15
79097:15	or, is there some reason 0 * not to *?* *t*-1,	no	12
79203:43	i, i'm glad, *-2 to see some of these things, i think 0 *t*-1.	yes	15
79223:32	i'm that's about my, uh, some on recycling	no	10
79402:37	and he said, um, * let's give her some race horse shots.	no	13
79534:27	i, i have some neighbors across the field,	no	8
79644:14	i've got some applications,	no	5
79767:78	the other thing about them is too, 0 if you really don't, you really need *-1 to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed, and haven't developed a credit thing. it stops you from *-2 doing a lot of things.	no	49
79860:51	and i, when i'd gotten back *t*-1 i had gotten some sun that day,	no	15
79920:19	it's just 0 some of those women that *t*-1 come up there *-2 looking like arnold schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it.	yes	25
79941:14	and there's some days 0 it's just like it *exp*-2's the hardest thing in the world * to, to get started *-1 *t*-3.	no	26
79971:18	you know, how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle *t*-1.	no	16
80076:41	but when you get into some of these, some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait *t*-1 *t*-2.	yes	21
80137:5	some people are a little bit fanatical about it.	no	9
80268:14	at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could *?*	yes	12
80284:13	she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire, i think 0 *t*-1.	no	16
80319:24	and i've been *-1 buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways 0 * to paint *t*-2.	no	20
80331:13	and you get some beautiful effects with them.	no	8
80516:64	so you really don't have *-1 to be disrupted for more than about a weekend. if you have some help.	no	21
80859:76	i think 0 you have * to let, yo-, you got *-1 to segregate some of it.	yes	17
81340:22	i mean, they're some of the best of, that *t*-1 are made *-2.	yes	14
81344:38	i think 0 he's up in a attic, or some part of school.	no	14
81357:34	and he's trying *-1 to save the land from some, ooze.	no	12
81438:33	and it's a brick house, with, uh, some wood.	no	10
81474:56	so it *exp*-1's kind of hard at that point * to, you know, classify some of the builders.	yes	19
81521:143	ninety, i would say 0 about, oh, about ninety-five percent, no i guess 0 may-, probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick, uh, with some wood.	no	29
81565:48	an, and while, while there are some advantages to that, there's less time spent * outside * making it look nice and taking care of things.	no	27
81656:23	um, we've actually had some warnings in, uh, raleigh uh, on air pollution.	no	14
81931:14	they were doing some, uh, ozone testing, and, uh, th-, the e p a	no	14
81932:19	and they were just screening some candidates,	no	7
82076:39	well, i'm going *-1 to have *-2 to get some.	no	11
82139:73	um, i, i was taking a voice i o class and, um, and actually doing some research,	no	17
82322:36	but, you know, i know 0 there are some days when she wi-, she wishes 0 she was back at work *t*-1.	no	22
82435:13	my wife did some teaching at like, uh, like a private tutoring place. a sylvan learning center this year	no	19
82690:38	uh, we're probably making a comparison against, uh, some european and, uh, and, uh, uh, s-s-say, newer republics that, uh, that *t*-1 have very high percentages.	no	27
82753:56	but part of the process also is that you must register, preregister at some particular point.	no	16
82832:83	* to if you, if you go on the attack, i-, and put some sensational thing before the public, as mike dukakis learned in the last campaign, and it is not refuted *-1, people will, you know, uh, believe it.	no	40
82833:49	if you don't refute it, as he didn't, there must be some truth to the matter, see.	no	19
83086:23	uh, i know 0 in some cases now in some states, depending on the criminal code, uh, a unanimous verdict is not required *-1.	no	24
83086:34	uh, i know 0 in some cases now in some states, depending on the criminal code, uh, a unanimous verdict is not required *-1.	no	24
83087:10	and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people,	no	9
83139:29	plus, i guess, 0 there was some credit for time 0 this guy had already spent in jail * waiting for trial *t*-1.	no	23
83187:159	but i know 0 you have a right * to ask for a jury in, in any sort of a case that even where damages are, are, are, uh, are the result of some sort of a, uh, an action that you are bringing *t*-1 against someone else *t*-2. you can ask for that to be heard *-4 before a jury.	no	61
83194:55	* takes a heck of a long time, i guess, * to get there in some states.	no	17
83253:46	so has our, i guess 0 our population has grown some too.	no	12
83423:17	but there's just some little difference that, um, *t*-1 causes it not to work an i-,	no	17
83609:24	it was starting *-1 to burn some oil.	no	8
83631:7	and some people will still buy them, you know,	no	9
83762:34	and i just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff.	no	14
83765:12	there was some plants that *t*-1 are just spring bloomers	no	10
83797:35	so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down. because i want them to come back up next year.	no	25
83827:75	about the only bloom, bulb that *t*-1 repeats well in my area is the, uh, uh, daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb.	yes	23
83830:17	now i have got some daffodils.	no	6
83850:28	the blooms 0 *t*-1 are, on some of them is yellow, purple, white. just all different colors.	yes	17
83878:12	it is some type of lily.	no	6
83884:16	i have got some in the backyard that *t*-1 bloomed blue. which i would not, would have liked *t*-3 those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better. and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color. with little purple spots that it, *t*-2 it will fade into a solid purple.	no	59
83884:123	i have got some in the backyard that *t*-1 bloomed blue. which i would not, would have liked *t*-3 those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better. and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color. with little purple spots that it, *t*-2 it will fade into a solid purple.	no	59
83972:12	it is some type of iris though.	no	7
84174:22	at new years, we had some people come in and, uh, like attack one of the planes. because they were protesting, uh, the presence over in the persian gulf.	no	29
84277:32	i mean, they are eighteen to twenty-four, some of the young men and women.	yes	14
84841:36	likewise, we, uh, we do some projects every now and then.	no	11
84882:66	so it *exp*-2's kind of hard for me to tell what *t*-1 would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland,	yes	24
84899:9	interestingly some of the information 0 i've been reading *t*-1 indicates that the amount of air pollution from, uh, uh, airplanes is extraordinary.	yes	24
85372:19	um, there are some areas *ich*-2 though where, where they have a problem with, uh, the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the, to the, uh *t*-1,	no	29
85376:69	or the foundation is sinking or something. you know, just a little, just a little bit, some more than others.	no	20

85613:41	and, and, uh,, i think 0 some different things *ich*-2 could come from what *t*-1's happened *t*-1, than what we expect *t*-3.	no	23
85736:59	and i, i think 0 we may not have ever have seen that without some of these, uh, newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the, the, uh, soldiers leaving, um, you know, surrendering and, trying *-1 to get out of that situation.	yes	44

86111:29	and you, there were some places, where people, defini-,	no	9
86145:23	what we did *t*-1 in some of the other cities and they tell you *-1 to do that is * to hire a local guide	yes	25

86732:58	you know, i don't want *-1 to get out there *-2 deer hunting and have some guy blow me away,	no	21
86784:11	there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington. regardless of the racial makeup,	no	17
86825:48	you know, the, the immediate need * to show some sort of violence *-1 to settle th-, the argument.	no	19
86828:64	and, and then i, i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree,	no	15
86846:12	that's some of the things 0 i think *t*-1 about it,	yes	12
86852:75	it seems anymore, uh, 0 a movie can not be considered *-1 good unless there's just some, some sort of violence, or something in it.	no	26
86896:94	and i, i, i, i have *-1 to think that, that it has some influence on it.	no	17

87309:72	i guess 0 some of the best things 0 i've ever had *t*-1, um, i, some of them were just hors d'oeuvres, you know.	yes	25
87657:24	that would provide, uh, possibly some relief there * to utilize some of the property taxes for other things *t*-2, see.	no	21
87657:43	that would provide, uh, possibly some relief there * to utilize some of the property taxes for other things *t*-2, see.	yes	21
87727:7	and some, people don't even own a car and know how * to drive a car *t*-1.	no	18

88330:11	i did some typing for my father when he had the company *t*-1	no	13
88362:23	and also, um, i do some work at u t d	no	11
88375:6	some of the commands just had nothing 0 * to do *t*-4 with, you know, what you were supposed *-2 to be doing *t*-3 what they, what they did *t*-1 on the com-, computer	yes	34
88401:100	and if you add it, if you put a footnote in, in the middle, you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have *-1 to footnote it, you just change, um, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you.	no	56
88429:48	so, um, if you, um, unless you have some other things 0 you want *-1 to talk about *t*-2 as * having *-3 to do with p c --s.	no	29
88465:44	although, um, i have also done oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing.	no	15

88485:17	i'm anxious *ich*-1 some day * to have one here.	no	11
88724:108	but, uh, so when you are first going to school *t*-4 that, you kind of have the luxury of *-1 being able *-2 to have some latitude in * choosing the place 0 * to go *t*-3.	no	37
88836:33	i, i was involved in some, uh, oh, alumnae recruiting, uh, here in town, uh, recently, uh, well last year.	no	20
88894:16	and she was wanting some more information.	no	7
88915:15	i think 0 some parents go a little bit overboard.	no	10
88964:5	some i don't.	no	4
89007:12	what are some others that you have seen *t*-1 lately *t*-2?	no	11
89092:13	and there were some others,	no	5
89135:65	they say 0 if you really want *-1 to be, uh, you really want some suspense, that's the one 0 * to see *t*-2.	no	25
89235:14	and i enjoy some of the michael j. fox movies.	yes	10
89482:64	see, when you have kids *t*-1, you like *-2 to be able *-3 to, send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them *t*-4.	no	29
89689:33	and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from *t*-1. is when people have *-2 to put people in a nursing homes *t*-3	yes	32
89695:84	and, uh, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who *t*-1 had, had, uh, apparently inhaled some chicken 0 he was eating *t*-2.	no	27
89707:31	so, i told them 0 he strangled on some chicken	no	10
89800:27	but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there	no	12
89885:12	he had some accomplices that *t*-1 were kind of suspect,	no	10
90501:30	and it was not only in mississippi, in some other places, as well,	no	13
90648:22	i think 0 that's some of it.	yes	8
90694:58	but, then again, uh, well, i, you know, i have some aunts that, uh, i, i, i do *?* *t*-1.	no	21
90771:19	so you probably could give some great advice.	no	8
90836:155	i, i think 0 i'd, i'd advise a parent *-1 to send a kid to a school *ich*-2, though, that *t*-3 has a number of different types of programs, you know, that, uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer *t*-1,	yes	50
90837:49	but some of the, uh, the small, some of the larger small schools, you know, i guess 0 around three or four thousand students have a, can offer a broader range of curriculums and things,	yes	35
90940:73	yet, like, say, you know, the university of small town in arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area.	no	22
90987:60	um, you know, when i first was applying for graduate schools *t*-1, i applied to some big programs *ich*-2, you know, in this area, like stevens institute of technology, which *t*-3 is recognized *-4 in the northeast as, as, you know, one step below m i t in a sense, you know,	no	52
91042:34	so you've really, uh, i guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything.	no	16
91300:34	i think 0 it was, um, oh, some actress reading it.	no	11
91357:15	i'm doing some reviews of books, *-2 just to, what, to sort of recommend to wh-, whether or not a full-scale review should be done *-1 for the journal,	no	30
91411:37	and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some, aspects of of bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, * to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.	no	53
91411:54	and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some, aspects of of bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, * to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.	no	53
91679:52	every, every family brings a, a dish of some kind,	no	10
91904:40	and it was, uh, just * to, uh, have some fellowship with her.	no	13
91983:14	we stayed at some park	no	5
92049:54	i mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those english words that you just don't exactly know what they mean *t*-1 *t*-2,	yes	28
92186:12	there were some people at the next table who *t*-1 spoke english,	no	12
92373:9	just some of the times they're continued *-1,	yes	9
92491:27	and i guess 0 maybe there are some parts of that,	no	11
92509:28	and i like, uh, gymnastics, and some track and field,	no	10
92598:48	maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, um, they've had some problems with, the recycling on plastic,	no	20
92857:5	some people are compl-, now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked *-1 up at the curbside, you know,	no	20
93017:41	or they will go *-1 dump it out in the middle of some ocean.	no	14
93069:93	and then once, about once every three or four years i try *-1 to get over to england, because i lived there for a while, some years back.	no	28
93357:13	so they took some time off that, uh, they could show us around.	no	13
93514:94	so even though i can look at it as a task, the, you know, i kind of get the, i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by *-1 saying, well, i'm lowering my chance of heart attack, and thus, that type stuff.	no	47
93571:57	you, you, you take the time *-1 to relax some how	no	11
93625:24	and i need *-1 to find some place 0 i could go *t*-2 and not feel like there's all these people who *t*-3 are just huge and hulking that *t*-4 are...	no	33
93723:14	that'll come some day when i,	no	7
93773:15	* must be some italian spices in there.	no	8
93871:32	for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some, um, tomato sauce in it,	no	16
94118:46	and we found that if it's in a certain part of texas, some people come,	no	16
94220:7	and some just come in for saturday	no	7
94225:29	and it's a chance * to see some of the relatives 0 you don't see *t*-1 all year long except that once a year.	yes	26
94285:16	and * choose, some place that everybody's going *-1 to like *t*-2 as far as food and all that.	no	20
94341:15	there have been some really wild shows put * on there.	no	11
94375:12	and, uh some people do	no	5
94379:7	and some people don't.	no	5
94473:20	but, you know, some that *t*-1 are *?* um, that, they're, they're not quite the same as the kids that *t*-2 are going to the inner city, uh, you know, public schools.	no	35
94490:53	it shows, i think 0 it shows that the parents have some, uh, desire for, for the kid to do, do well, you know,	no	24
94509:26	and i think 0 this is happening some around the country in terms of, um, morals, * trying *-1 to teach the kinds of things that, that *t*-2 aren't getting taught *-3 at home, and, uh, and, and respect for other people.	no	43
94569:132	and, um, about, i guess 0 about when the first, when the youngest one was in kindergarten *t*-2 i started *-1 working at a preschool and, uh, you know, doing some work,	no	32
94794:154	but when time came *-6 to direct their ability 0 * to make choices to develop the kinds of things that, that they're going *-1 to need *t*-4 *-2 to interact with other people *t*-3 *t*-5, i felt like i needed some strong influence there.	no	46
94939:11	i do some p c stand alone work on it,	no	10
94994:24	um, well, i actually do some work, *-1 working at m i t and at nist, national institute of standards and technology in washington,	no	24
95130:15	she told me some of the things 0 you can do *t*-1,	yes	12
95167:11	i do some	no	3
95181:14	it's got some pretty strong competitors.	no	7
95230:78	and that gives me the opportunity * to, uh, come in to work and fix it, if i can't think of some thing 0 * to tell the trouble shooter *t*-1 while we're on the phone.	no	38
95240:42	well, i, i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that *t*-1 have happened lately, that i think 0 there are some occupations that they should, such as the health field, the transportation field, uh,	yes	39
95240:102	well, i, i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that *t*-1 have happened lately, that i think 0 there are some occupations that they should, such as the health field, the transportation field, uh,	no	39
95246:99	so, i, i, uh, i, i, i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions,	no	16
95399:24	there's got *-1 to be some backup * to say that	no	12
95430:36	but out on the line, they've got people working some serious equipment.	no	13
95440:131	i, i just think 0 employers have *-1 to have, * especially given today, the drug abuse that *t*-2 goes on, i just think 0 employers have *-3 to have some kind of way 0 * to see that they're not being put *-7 at risk *t*-6. because they're the ones who *t*-4 are going *-5 to have the lawsuits, the insurance claims, et cetera,	no	67
95449:39	and, and i'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to, uh, illnesses brought * on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse.	yes	28
95516:93	and, and then they say, well, if you give them the right * to do this, then they're going *-1 to take some other right away from you,	no	29
95595:76	but, uh, i would, i think 0 it would be smart if somebody would keep, uh, some sort of a plan that *t*-1 works for them.	no	26
95629:47	well, as a matter of fact, uh, my mother was going through some things *ich*-2 not lon-, not long ago, i guess 0 it has been a couple of years ago, in an old trunk that she had *t*-1.	no	39
95637:49	i mean it was, it was just almost laughable in some instances that, you know,	no	15
95688:54	well, uh, we have tried *-1 to, uh, instill some, some sense of, uh, of budgeting in our kids,	no	19
95858:17	and i can take some real great tours to europe.	no	10
96024:12	they have some, but not, not so much.	no	8
96028:44	um, if you go further down, uh, you will usually find some, but not right in there.	no	17
96252:12	we have some engineers that *t*-1 still,	no	7
96320:28	so, there are some, some strides 0 *t*-1 to be made *-2 there.	no	13
96339:138	and, uh, uh, i guess 0 my, i, uh, the one, my one bad thing is that i am, that i wish 0 my mother had had some of those opportunities, because, i think 0 she would have really, she rea-, would have succeeded in a lot of ways, that men, that women were not able *-1 to succeed *t*-2, in her, generation.	yes	63
96371:41	so, she is pretty much, although there were some other women in her class, she was, you know, uh, one of the minorities,	no	23
96462:35	and so. but i know 0 some of the other services do not think that women are capable of *-1 doing the job.	yes	23
96466:37	they were. i was listening to some of the comments on ra-, television *ich*-1 the other day, uh, about it,	yes	20
96478:43	but i just would rather have, uh, a man *ich*-1 doing some of these jobs than a woman.	yes	18
96482:12	there's some men out there that *t*-1 are more feminine than most women.	no	14
96600:105	because, uh, i, i guess 0 i placed all but one or two of my calls. and, uh, only because i going *-1 to make some money,	no	27
96703:14	it's, some good, some bad, uh,	no	7
96703:21	it's, some good, some bad, uh,	no	7
96826:19	or we really do develop some health problems.	no	8
96918:79	i was rea-, i was really looking forward to summer, thinking oh, we are going *-1 to have some time off.	no	21
97143:12	i have some friends that *t*-1 have children,	no	8
97185:20	well hopefully i can do some consulting work at home.	no	10
97278:7	and some were just different objects that *t*-1 have, had a definite purpose for kids, you know,	no	17
97407:28	and, you know, * maybe do some free lance type work at home.	no	13
97460:30	and * have, have some kind of real good program, set *-1 up so that you, when you go *t*-2 you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows c p r or first aid	no	41
97464:29	or, and * have some kind of program set *-1 up, like you say, * to stimulate the kids, or educate them in some manner. and have the, you know, the right toys and the right setting and, uh, have, a, an organized type of program set *-2 up so that the kids have a schedule, you know,	no	58
97464:92	or, and * have some kind of program set *-1 up, like you say, * to stimulate the kids, or educate them in some manner. and have the, you know, the right toys and the right setting and, uh, have, a, an organized type of program set *-2 up so that the kids have a schedule, you know,	no	58
97552:6	some of the changing roles of women in that respect, i have been a product of *t*-1.	yes	17
97812:24	and i think 0 there are some people that *t*-1 have done that,	no	13
98498:26	that, those are some important points.	no	6
98532:93	and, uh, as a say, i, i tend *-1 to be around, uh, civil cases because i've been an expert witness some,	no	23
98534:37	and one thing that you get *t*-2 if you have some expertise is, uh, you know the range of, of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime *t*-1.	no	33
98551:5	some people just sit on them once in their lifetime, you know, if they're that lucky sometimes. or, you know, what, whatever the case may be *t*-1. and, and may not have any idea of what, what the standard punishment *ich*-2 would be *t*-3 for it.	no	47
98558:31	and it, they may have some different idea,	no	8
98723:39	but, you don't know, uh, i guess at some of the other schools 0 you go to *t*-1 unless you've been there.	yes	24
98733:75	and it's, it *exp*-1's interesting * to notice when you go to different schools *t*-2 that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual, uh,	no	32
98735:31	i, i think 0 some of the dress codes are different at different schools.	yes	14
98762:52	and one might be a hat day where you have *-1 to come up with some sort of hat *t*-2.	no	20
98802:9	because some of the teachers 0 i know *t*-1 wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had *t*-2 dry cleaned *-3 so they have got the crease	yes	35
98813:74	i think 0 the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, i think.	yes	28
98822:24	and you can see 0 in some of the departments in some of the schools, like history at clark, they're all pretty fancy.	yes	24
98822:40	and you can see 0 in some of the departments in some of the schools, like history at clark, they're all pretty fancy.	yes	24
98860:6	some of those male coaches, that might really,	yes	8
98924:11	well, some of them, yes they do	yes	7
98925:33	and, and it's not at some of the private schools,	yes	11
99116:22	uh, and so that was some of,	yes	7
99175:5	some schools i know 0 *t*-1 give, uh, oh,	no	9
99204:91	and i'm, you know, showing them 0 if you're strong in math and science, kiddos, this is one area where women can make some decent money *t*-1. you know.	no	31
99218:30	well, it sounds like he's got some really, you know, good strong ideas of what he wants *-1 to do *t*-2.	no	22
99306:46	you know, and here it was like, pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime	no	16
99396:31	that's enough * to, uh, do some boating	no	9
99480:45	so but, uh, you know, we probably did some ice skating on it,	no	13
99488:18	christmas time, uh, some of our relatives would come up from alabama,	yes	12
100066:25	her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in *t*-1.	no	21
100089:8	and some of them, i think 0 *t*-1 unconsciously do it, you know, as a just, you know, half seni-,	yes	20
100102:51	you know, * go to the dining room and, and eat some good meals.	no	14
100121:26	usually there has *-1 to be some wealth involved *, which *t*-2 is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money	no	35
100122:41	but the, the places like presbyterian village and some of the, the retirement places where, where they have different levels of care *t*-1 seems *-2 to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.	yes	36
100302:47	and, uh, i had opportunities in high school, * to work in some programs, um	no	15
100340:29	um, but i do know 0 through some organized groups like scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities.	no	20
100411:91	and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way 0 * to get that feeling back *t*-1. um, if we've lost some of that	yes	25
100498:28	i'm glad that there are still some areas that, that *t*-1 get the youth involved *-2 in that sort of thing.	no	22
100547:39	but from * talking to people in other districts there are some major problems, uh, with dropouts.	no	17
100646:89	and schools now are supposed *-1 to solve social problems, uh, mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try *-2 to provide them with some security.	no	30
100771:88	and * let everyone have an opportunity * to reach higher education if they're willing, you know, *-1 to work and have, uh, some ability.	no	26
100975:51	this is something that *t*-1 ought *-2 to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff 0 they do *t*-3.	yes	23
100990:12	so, in some ways i think 0 *t*-1 the, the day schools do serve those purposes.	no	16
101092:17	um, it's some kind of advisory board *ich*-2 0 they've put *t*-1 together for parents and children	no	19
101537:103	it, it's, as much as you want *?*, you know torn * up and, and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery	no	31
101548:7	and some hard-boiled eggs.	no	4
101736:15	i've had some from plano, too.	no	7
101971:47	i know 0 they do do some, they do have some classes *ich*-3 *ich*-4 in, um, high schools and things for kids 0 *t*-1 to, uh, give them an idea of what family life is like *t*-2 and the, uh, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing	no	48
102087:22	and i'm not fond of some of those things	yes	10
102325:20	i went to dinner with some friends last weekend	no	9
102544:8	but some of the different things 0 we're doing *t*-1, uh there's just not a time, enough time 0 * to do it all *t*-2	yes	27

102740:38	my in-laws also enjoy prime rib, when they've had some of their specials on sunday, monday, or tuesday night *t*-1	yes	21
103023:20	but i know 0 in some areas, it's really, it, it really is bad.	no	15
103109:5	some people are really afraid * to recycle the fuel because they're afraid 0 it could become, uh, bomb quality.	no	21
103120:13	my line gets some static.	no	5
103172:75	it's just, you know, a possible solution in the future, i think 0 *t*-1, * maybe to help in some ways.	no	22
103192:43	i, i think, 0 with * solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well.	yes	25
103192:87	i, i think, 0 with * solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well.	yes	25
103248:15	we'll have some interesting discussion, i guess 0 *t*-1.	no	10
103332:28	but you know i guess 0 to some people it *exp*-1'd almost be better *ich*-2 * to die to them than * to spend life in prison or whatever	no	30
103413:142	, i mean, i'm, i'm not saying 0 i, i think 0 capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case, you know, especially because there are some cases when you just don't know *t*-1	no	41
103456:48	and, and, it really isn't, for some people tha-, who *t*-1 have been there for over, and over, and over, it really isn't, uh, as bad.	no	28
103741:63	not, not, you know, the bouncy, you know * sing along kind but some of the old, older ones that	yes	20
103748:5	some, i don't even, i recognize the, the melodies, and whatnot,	no	12
103775:50	it's kind of haunting, you know, on, on some of the notes.	yes	13
103800:45	does it, does it offer, like band, or some of the instruments?	yes	12
103886:24	and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just 0 everybody was, was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were *t*-1.	no	32
104240:43	and there's some, i think 0 there's some good disney movies fixing * to come out on video, uh, shipwrecked.	no	22
104589:11	i got some good recipes from them sometimes,	no	8
104674:70	i, when i bought the computer *t*-1, all of a sudden i was receiving them, for some unknown reason, through the mail.	no	22
104752:40	i, i guess 0 there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want *-1 to give to *t*-4. uh, be it through different organizations, march of dimes type, uh, telethons or, or bicycle rides or whatever, how they fund whatever, uh, illness they wish *t*-2 *t*-3.	no	49
104874:47	i, i have a real fear, but that at some point something's going *-1 to happen.	no	17
104882:43	uh, some people just, uh, i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel 0 it's an invasion of privacy and things like that,	no	32
105028:21	but, uh, we did some water skiing *ich*-1, of course, and, and, uh, * driving around the lake in the boat	no	21
105365:54	i think 0 that's something 0 we might want *t*-1, too, is some kind of standard transmission *ich*-2 at least rather than automatic.	no	24
105449:34	because i think 0 they may put them into some sort of a program 0 *t*-1 to get them off of drugs.	no	22
105526:53	and i think 0 it *exp*-2's good that they're trying *-1 to start some programs down in the elementary schools.	no	22
105896:30	i'd have *-1 to go back through some expense reports.	no	11
105900:50	but particularly, down in your area, i'm looking for some, some more restaurants.	no	14
106021:28	this is going *-1 to give me some more places 0 * to go *t*-2.	no	15
106068:20	but i think that at some times it can be the right thing 0 * to do *t*-1.	no	18
106196:54	well that's, yeah, that's right that the children have some responsibility *ich*-1 *ich*-3, too, to their parents and such, * to help * decide what *t*-2's the right thing.	no	32
106250:27	and the second one was 0 i bought some toys at a, um, at a craft fair.	no	17

106322:95	well, um, so * to speak, i had *-2 to paint this, uh, the inside of this warehouse thing that you keep some, um, farm equipment in *t*-1	no	28
106678:13	and then for some reason * taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form, uh, causes you to realize how much *t*-1 is left *-2.	no	33
106889:37	and i think though that we need *-1 to have some liquid *ich*-3 around that you don't have *-2 to go through the company *-5 to get *t*-4.	no	29
107099:26	and there are, you know, some places that *t*-1 will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff.	no	19
107178:48	i have a friend who *t*-1 just went to, like, wyoming to some big ranch, you know, where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion *t*-2.	no	29
107341:30	and i think 0 we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think 0 they have more humidity.	yes	20
107427:21	i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing,	no	13
107433:47	i, it, i have worked in some campaigns	no	8
107540:43	and i don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this *t*-1.	yes	17
107811:32	i guess 0 you have *-1 to take some things and leave some things.	no	14
107811:42	i guess 0 you have *-1 to take some things and leave some things.	no	14
107928:71	but when i don't need *-1 to dress up for a, a meeting or a service of some sort *t*-2, i don't.	no	24
107978:81	so you don't have *-1 to, you don't have *-2 to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do *t*-3.	yes	33
108150:96	uh, lot of the shows that, that i've liked *t*-1 in the past, like, uh, oh, golden girls and, some of them tend *-1 to get so risque,	yes	29
108364:6	some of the punk, um, when i was in high school *t*-1, that was, uh, one of the big things, was punk music,	yes	23
108365:80	and, uh, a lot of it is, has a lot 0 *-3 to say *t*-2, or some of it has a lot 0 *-4 to say *t*-1,	yes	27
108372:78	uh, well, it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of the people who *t*-1 enjoy the music	yes	23
108385:11	um, some of it, um,	yes	5
108418:34	and then some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in urban society.	yes	22
108418:56	and then some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in urban society.	no	22

108426:87	i guess 0 i don't really care *-1 to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times.	no	30
108435:57	um, i don't like *-1 to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the time, anyway.	yes	20
108439:46	but i don't really care *-1 to listen to it any more for some reason.	no	16
108484:38	you can't understand what they're saying *t*-1 on some of those songs which *t*-2 probably is just as well on some of them, too.	yes	26
108484:74	you can't understand what they're saying *t*-1 on some of those songs which *t*-2 probably is just as well on some of them, too.	yes	26
108493:86	but i, i definitely, i really enjoy the fifties *rnr*-2, the sixties *rnr*-2 and a lot, some of the seventies *rnr*-2 rock and roll	no	24
108530:15	then i have some from like church that *t*-1 are more family recipes that *t*-2 are more useful. you know, budget cookbooks,	no	22
108599:70	and it consisted of, of grilled kielbasa sausage uh, a potato salad with olive oil, and uh, some tomatoes that *t*-1 had been chopped *-2 up with onions and curry powder	no	31
108600:10	and probably some yogurt was in there.	no	7

108849:8	well some schools may even give you financial aid, where another one won't *?* *t*-1.	no	17
108974:18	but i guess 0 some of the other smaller colleges might, might be a lot different.	yes	16
109223:36	so, i guess 0 we're old timers compared to some people.	no	12
109291:52	but the trucks that *t*-1 were supposed * to do it, there's been some problems with *t*-4 from what i've read *t*-3 in, you know, the mail that we get *t*-2	no	33

111634:21	those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment.	no	10
111642:23	i sometimes have a problem with some of the, especially more famous people who *t*-1 all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork *-2 to say that whatever problems they have *t*-3, you know, was, was because they were abused a-, abused *-4 as children.	yes	47
111709:41	and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some miss america was abused *-1 by the man 0 she loved *t*-2	no	26

113059:15	we drive by some houses *ich*-2 everyday that *t*-1 have big signs,	no	12
113375:25	and, uh, * seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from, from that direction.	no	17
113433:64	if they were *-1 to take half of what they spend *t*-3 on that and put it on some economic, you know, inter-, intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might *?*.	no	36

118317:79	and, um, i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.	yes	27
118337:14	i think in some ways that *t*-1 they need *-2 to be more careful of the teachers that they hire *t*-3.	no	21
118353:34	i've, i've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers	no	14

119425:11	we bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for christmas,	no	11
119528:95	and i think 0 that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something *t*-1 and, you know, had some pride in it *t*-1.	no	28

125891:58	i've got where now i can hit it in, in the air some of the time *t*-1.	yes	18
125907:106	well, that i, i guess 0 that's what i need *-1 to do *t*-2 is, is * get some kind of lessons or something.	no	25
126073:18	i guess 0 in some cases they just consider *-1 pickup your, your phone and, and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not.	no	34

127487:16	not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into *t*-1.	no	13
127632:40	so i don't, i don't know some of those shows now, like i used *-1 to *?*.	yes	20
127759:25	i mean, they'll have some things *ich*-1 in there that *t*-2 almost, almost, you know, like supernatural, or something, you know,	no	22
127907:10	occasionally, some ice skating will come on, on a sunday or during the olympics	no	14
128082:18	but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning, just like * brushing your teeth you're going *-1 to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour.	no	30
128203:27	and then you go *-1 to read some order book or something	no	12
128211:32	uh, i suppose 0 things, some things well happen slowly simply by * having it taught *-1 in the schools more to the extent that that's happening, * having a new generation *ich*-3 come up that *t*-2's more used to it.	no	43
128271:12	they have some of those in ohio.	yes	7
128574:17	but, did they have some pretty good special effects?	no	9
128653:11	they have some good management principals in this new generation.	no	10
128741:28	what do you feel 0 *t*-1 are some of the main problems?	yes	12
129152:27	i'm going *-1 to look into some other fields.	no	10
129591:19	so, we might have some cocktails *ich*-1 ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.	no	19
129591:60	so, we might have some cocktails *ich*-1 ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.	no	19
129591:75	so, we might have some cocktails *ich*-1 ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.	no	19
129592:38	one of our favorites is, uh, * to take some, * let's see philadelphia cream cheese i think, is that what *t*-1 comes in those little blocks? and pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and, uh, wash them and cool them and then dump them in the, uh, sauce and then take crackers	no	63
129714:43	and, uh, so we've done that for quite some time,	no	11
129744:37	although just, just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, uh, *t*-1 work in the library for me said 0 they hadn't gotten theirs.	yes	28
129782:55	i do news, mostly newspapers and, uh, plastic two liter diet coke bottles. and aluminum cans some,	no	17
129820:27	well, i guess 0 there are some places, uh, in the north, in particular that, uh, *t*-1 have a real definite way of * encouraging you to recycle	no	28
129842:12	what are some of the things 0 they don't recycle *t*-1 *t*-2.	yes	13
130539:29	and i mostly went to germany and visited some friends of my family and, uh, hung out with them, worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp.	no	34
130609:46	uh, the closest thing 0 i did *t*-1 was * go to some like, uh, restored castles and stuff.	no	19
130613:26	that, there is some on that west coast of france	no	10
130779:110	what, what *t*-1 really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e-, even some money 0 * basically to take care of the gas 0 * to recycle it *t*-4 *t*-5, you know what i mean *t*-2, then people tend *-3 to do it.	no	51
130800:49	and, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass *t*-1 on to the consumer, you know,	no	30
130800:69	and, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass *t*-1 on to the consumer, you know,	no	30
130831:73	and one way that we do it sort of in, in iowa *t*-1 is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops.	yes	26
130945:16	well, we have some very nice hou-, homes here in this area.	no	12
130983:8	but some of those are pretty big.	yes	7
131019:41	and, i guess 0 he, he did some crazy thing *-1 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal.	no	26
131019:58	and, i guess 0 he, he did some crazy thing *-1 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal.	no	26
131026:14	and, so, some were vacant for quite a while before they, you know, they finally sold them because there were so many.	no	22
131113:19	well, we do to some degree	no	6
131302:38	so, uh, it *exp*-1 would be kind of exciting in some ways * to, to see a little bit more of that	no	22
131303:7	and some ways, it might be kind of scary.	no	9
131544:12	especially in some of these schools around here, i think 0 they have about twenty percent older students.	yes	18
131550:15	i've seen some people that *t*-1 are really quite up there you know	no	14
131658:35	* are going *-1 to have *-2 to solve some of the problem, huh.	yes	14
131749:37	i probably need *-1 to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current and, uh, and practice more often.	no	19
132170:17	and there's probably some truth to that.	no	8
132413:27	like, * try *-1 to get some place and exercise from five to six,	no	14
132424:22	well, i know, 0 some people go during lunch,	no	9
132476:19	it beats memberships at some of these clubs.	yes	8
132716:168	and then you just dip the carcass in, uh, boiling water, pull it out, and there's a, we use a little raspy brush, 0 *t*-1 pulls the hair off, and, uh, gut it, and, uh, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, uh, some pineapple, about three pineapples, you know, * sliced them up, and, uh, cover him up with, uh, wet, uh, sacks, feed sacks is what i usually use *t*-2 and then start a charcoal fire on top of him.	no	87
132716:182	and then you just dip the carcass in, uh, boiling water, pull it out, and there's a, we use a little raspy brush, 0 *t*-1 pulls the hair off, and, uh, gut it, and, uh, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, uh, some pineapple, about three pineapples, you know, * sliced them up, and, uh, cover him up with, uh, wet, uh, sacks, feed sacks is what i usually use *t*-2 and then start a charcoal fire on top of him.	no	87

133032:24	um, and it really saved us some big money once.	no	10
133248:14	i certainly have some ideas since i'm studying it now in college.	no	13
133378:41	but i do think that we have *-1 to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five, six grades and just keep *-2 going over and over and over until most of those that *t*-3 are capable can at least learn *-4 to read and write	yes	52
133508:12	what are some of the other questions *t*-1.	yes	8
133683:50	well, it went pretty well, uh, other than the fact that we encountered some, uh, problems that you run across *t*-1 in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another *t*-2,	no	33
134185:52	and i think that it's, it's very surprising 0 some of these very expensive volvos can be gotten *-1 for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing *-2 to buy ones that *t*-3 are about, the vintage of the cars that you and i currently own *t*-4	yes	54
134199:14	well, certainly some of the top end ones.	yes	8
134266:50	uh, the state of wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against illinois because of the air pollution 0 we were getting *t*-1.	no	26
134334:65	maybe to you and i who *t*-1 have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, i think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware *ich*-2, uh, rather quickly of, of what *t*-3's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is *t*-4.	no	56
134341:41	and we'll let them try *-1 to drink out of some of the lakes and try *-1 to fish in some of the lakes that *t*-2 have been suffering from, uh, the, uh, acid rain	yes	36
134341:71	and we'll let them try *-1 to drink out of some of the lakes and try *-1 to fish in some of the lakes that *t*-2 have been suffering from, uh, the, uh, acid rain	yes	36
134364:43	i think 0 it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of, of the gary area	yes	21

134464:48	i think, um, i was thinking about *-1 throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets	no	28

142030:25	you know, i mean, some topics,	no	6
142052:37	well, it seems like, i don't know, some things are sensationalized *-1	no	13

142064:55	and, uh, i also like *-1 to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts.	no	19

142418:201	but, uh, you know, right now, uh, what we did *t*-1, my wife and i, is 0 we got a mobile home. one of these twelve by forty-eight's that *t*-2 got repoed *-3, and, uh, swapped them a cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring 0 i would build a house some day, you know.	no	61
142642:12	there are some columns that *t*-1 could be painted *-2 *-3 a different color too.	no	15
142923:84	as far as the rangers are concerned *-1, i think, i think 0 they need some, definitely need some pitching.	no	20
142973:83	and i think 0 you're probably right, that they, that they need some, you know, some changes in, uh, pitching coach, maybe	no	23
142994:34	they need *-1 to have some, some young guys that *t*-2 can take the lead	no	15
143109:20	actually now you can get some really good deals *-1 flying over,	no	12
143137:40	you know, i'd like *-1 to go to hawaii some time,	no	12
143198:38	well, you'll just have *-1 to plan a vacation some time and, and go over there.	no	17
143327:28	it sounds like we've been to some of the same places.	yes	12
143645:21	and there are, uh, some fairly sophisticated approaches that *t*-1 are used *-2 in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people, uh, gain a competence with respect to the material.	no	36
143680:38	you must see kids with real significant problems, uh, in some cases.	no	12
143814:17	but i know 0 some people can get, get, you know, carried *-1 away with them and let them get out of hand.	no	23
143835:16	it seems that some of them have gotten higher	yes	9
143841:50	i don't know if it was tennessee or arkansas or some, some other state 0 *t*-1 had a visa card that *t*-2 was the lowest one in the country.	no	30
143936:15	i've got some that i, you know, i haven't even used *t*-1 at all, uh, past few years	no	20
144096:32	well, th-, there were some people that, uh, that *t*-1 had a problem with that. because they found out later on that, jeez, you know, a guy will lie rather than get killed *-2.	no	34
144544:40	but, uh, uh, i know that, uh, in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing * to prevent, you know, so that, uh, the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything.	yes	45
144705:86	a lot of the, my family, you know, they fear me working like that and, under some, some of those conditions,	no	21
145004:14	and you hear some people say, you know, well, he's a man,	no	13
145350:46	i, i know pe-, i know some other people that *t*-1 have done that.	no	14
145353:19	uh, i got in some problems with, uh, financial problems because of credit cards	no	14
145367:62	i h-, i have, we have some, some friends that *t*-1 did the, exactly the same thing.	no	17
145433:60	even with my gas card you know, i find that i'll go in *-1 to get some gas	no	19
145456:31	i mean, there are sort some inherent limits there,	no	9
145538:67	i, in fact, i've, i've even, uh, heard some people that *t*-1 have applied for credit cards with much less, uh rates and have paid off their, you know higher interest rate, uh cards and just sent them back, you know.	no	43
145554:69	and i, i guess 0 there's some, there's, uh, uh, some negotiating there, too,	no	16
145693:13	and they took some rooms down at a holiday inn	no	10
145694:20	and, uh, they had some activity,	no	6
145725:35	uh, i found out some, about some of the relatives	no	10
145726:75	i didn't, you know, i, i didn't even know their names, some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles	yes	28
145726:101	i didn't, you know, i, i didn't even know their names, some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles	yes	28
145920:28	because i looked into *-1 picking up some, uh, medical insurance for my, just for my family, you know, just,	no	20
145948:130	i guess 0 what, the other benefits that, uh, that i, uh, that i miss *t*-1, i guess is, uh, you know, some of the bonuses and stuff that that *t*-2 goes on with just * being involved *-3 with a big company, you know	yes	45
146094:19	um, i've done some cross stitching.	no	7
146202:136	well, one thing that i like *t*-1 about this fabric painting thing is 0 i can just make a t shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then, um, cut out a little pattern *ich*-2 from the material, from some material, like flowers or something, and make, um, a design or, you know, a little arrangement or something on the shirt and, you know, fuse it on with heat and bond, or whatever and then paint around it.	no	80
146229:41	so i had, i went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back	no	16
146546:25	i do think that there are some significant kinds of things 0 * to to look for *t*-4 *ich*-1, you know, if you are faced *-2 with * placing someone. in a place like that, uh, you know, aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that *t*-3 is offered *-5 and such	no	53
146578:18	some, some of the, uh, the people that *t*-1 are in there are real, you know, very nice and friendly to everybody	no	22
146596:83	i think 0 it would matter too, uh, kinds of, uh, disabilities that the nursing home accepts *t*-1. because there are some, uh, who *t*-2 poor things, you know, don't have, uh, any real grasp on reality any longer.	no	40
146614:76	well, it is like, wel-, the one that i worked in *t*-1, uh, you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day,	yes	25
146620:33	and then you would see see some of the others that *t*-1 are were like distant from the other group	yes	20
146621:60	and they they just didn't like participate together with the others because they had some some, uh, i guess, uh, slight mental disabilities and things like that.	no	28
146663:14	and there are some fire stations 0 i can take newspapers to *t*-1	no	13
146711:46	and i think 0 it is going *-1 to come to that because some people will just not go to the,	no	21
146767:23	well, on-, some of them are five,	no	7
146768:5	some are ten cents.	no	4
146830:12	you see some of the stuff	yes	6
146883:11	you buy some	no	3
146901:16	because i had some appointments at the office *ich*-1 today, some interviews	no	12
146901:37	because i had some appointments at the office *ich*-1 today, some interviews	no	12
146950:25	so *-1 to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades, uh, older grades, i had *-1 to wear heels.	yes	23
147069:16	i know that some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,	yes	23
147085:37	um, oh, it, there's some good things about it	no	10
147239:53	but i think, uh, 0 we're going *-1 to have *-2 to make some fundamental changes	no	17
147292:13	and they needed some quality care,	no	6
147338:27	i am sure 0 you have got some really good nursing homes around dallas.	no	14
147341:8	and some of them are limited care *ich*-2 too where people can do, uh,	yes	14
147478:44	so, i, you know, you pick up some traits from her and stuff.	no	13
147583:29	and it *exp*-1's just too bad that some people, you know, still look down on them just because of their color. you know.	no	24
147615:5	some people say oh the boys shouldn't have *-1 to do those jobs. the inside jobs.	no	17
147697:28	but i wish 0 they would get some more on that.	no	11
147755:52	and personally i feel 0 it's probably, there's probably some of each.	yes	14
147829:43	and it almost seems like in order *-1 to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have *-1 to have the kind of wife that you would only find *t*-2, on, say in the bobsy twins or, something like that.	yes	41
147885:34	the japanese government is always having a, some kind of a scandal.	no	12
147922:86	oh, well, i guess 0 i like a wide range. uh, everything from, uh, from baroque through at least some modern music.	no	22
148133:33	uh, i suppose 0 that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because i do get things from ski associations and things, uh, at, during the year.	no	29
148187:41	i'd like *-1 to go to sundance and park city and some of those.	yes	15
148204:16	and then we have some church magazines,	no	7
148360:9	even some of that i like *t*-1 okay but not, mostly, as a general rule,	yes	15
148377:14	and i like some of their songs.	yes	7
148462:27	i, i like some of it, um,	yes	7
148469:11	um, some of it sounds more like pop music.	yes	9
148536:16	um, i have some spiro gyro tapes.	no	7
148545:11	i have some dulcimer music.	no	5
148568:15	i mean, some people sing,	no	5
148897:37	* got that, uh, uh, some insight *ich*-2 there, 0 *t*-1 to, to kind of help me put together the feelings.	no	21
149155:55	you know, when you write a test *t*-1 you have *-2 to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing *t*-3 and find out which ones *t*-4 are discriminating well and which ones *t*-5 aren't *?* find out how reliable the test is *t*-6,	no	52
149169:21	well, i was doing some of the same stuff, but doing it more slowly, and with smaller files.	yes	18
149231:71	oh, we spend a lot of time outdoors *-1 jogging, bicycling, uh, going to the park, um, some time *-1 watching v c r movies um,	no	26
149249:6	some of the things 0 we do *t*-1 together as a family, we like *-2 to play games a lot,	yes	20
149297:15	so you have some in the nest and some out, huh.	no	11
149297:29	so you have some in the nest and some out, huh.	no	11
149432:17	oh, i have some relatives out there in texas,	no	9
149502:68	he's, uh, he has been really aggressive, uh, especially towards my little girl, for some reason.	no	17
149583:38	and we ended up with, uh, oh, malamute and some other kind of mix.	no	14
149615:70	you know, i saw something *ich*-3 on c n n or on cable here a while ago that *t*-2 showed some people that *t*-1 had rabbits in apartments and in houses,	no	31
149669:8	and some of the weirdest animals 0 you ever want *-1 to see *t*-2 in there.	yes	16
149727:73	and especially in this election year, i think that, uh, there ought *-1 to be so-, at least some conversation about what we are supposed *-2 to do *t*-3 about this.	no	31
149820:43	but with this peace dividend, it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had *?* in the thirties, or whatever.	no	29
149911:186	um, what *t*-1 really bothers me is 0 it just seems like if, if anyone were *-2 to say, you know, well i'm going *-3 to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're mumblex, we're going *-4 to have *-5 to do some unpopular things, i mean, he wouldn't have a chance of * getting elected *-6.	no	62
149978:23	and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,	no	12
149990:22	you know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends *-1 to be where a lot of that crime is focused *-2 *t*-3	yes	29
150133:52	i've actually, i've known, known some people that *t*-1 have had their cars stolen *-2.	no	17
150146:7	and some superficial type damage,	no	5
150248:40	and the, uh, microwave had *-1 to have, uh, some kind of something 0 i can't even pronounce *t*-2,	no	20
150976:42	if you wanted *-1 to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it	no	16
150984:71	i guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *t*-1 is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who *t*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4.	no	47
151063:96	yeah, i mean, i, i really, i would like *-1 to, uh, to do at some point, um,	no	18
151066:23	but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.	no	15
151118:86	in, in the case 0 you were involved in *t*-1, you said 0 it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind.	no	24
151317:32	but, uh, apparently for some, some crimes, it *exp*-1's permissible * to have six people sit in judgment.	no	19
151348:25	it was *?*, yeah, in some of the critical things, like the off-, special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,	yes	28
151377:38	but, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, *-1 looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,	no	27
151543:30	well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far.	yes	16
151564:32	i mean * suppose 0 they found out some other way?	no	11
151577:22	uh, like i said, some industries, though, i think 0 it'd be very necessary,	no	15
151774:60	and, uh, each one of the, everybody that *t*-1 showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for like soft drinks	no	23
152257:56	and uh, our benefits package isn't, uh, isn't quite as good in some ways. uh, you know,	no	19
152303:35	unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have *-1 to finagle your way around *-2 to get that time.	no	31
152303:56	unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have *-1 to finagle your way around *-2 to get that time.	no	31
152490:25	i mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.	no	12
152494:12	like in some of the large oil companies. there has been massive lay offs.	yes	14
152569:103	although he, you know, * the more complex 0 your structure *?* *t*-2 the, uh, less difficult it *exp*-1 is *t*-3 * to kind of carry some things through	no	30
152831:108	uh, my, my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to washington or to the state and they say 0 they are going *-1 to send some back,	no	30
153023:355	also, also i have the observation *ich*-6 of, uh, with the press is that, like any any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of *t*-1 that i see *t*-2 in the press, you know, which *t*-3 only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that *t*-4 actually had, had more than just a blurb about it. that the press has managed *-5 to just mess up some aspect of the story	no	86
153314:52	they're their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens	no	15
153357:7	and some he destroys *t*-1	no	5
153358:7	and some he keeps *t*-1.	no	5
153435:29	because i mean i do think that some people need them and, like, for protection and stuff	no	17
153931:85	they, i guess 0 they passed a couple of, uh, uh, laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go *-1 to buy a hand gun *t*-2	no	37
153957:35	i guess, i guess 0 some forms of guns should probably be controlled *-1	no	14
153995:24	you know, i have done some bow hunting	no	8
154149:47	well, even if it's not technical. if it's, uh, some social thing or whatever. it doesn't matter.	no	20
154306:16	we have gotten some of our loans paid *-1 off really because of this and stuff like that	yes	18
154553:11	i like some country music.	no	5
154734:49	and, uh, i was kind of interested *-1 to hear cause they had some people from the e p a and lots of different places	no	25
154759:31	they were able *-1 to sell it for some amount per ton	no	12
154769:18	we *ich*-2're doing some here in, in cash valley, the community here.	no	13
154782:102	so one of the real keys, it sounds like *t*-1, to * getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is * to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.	no	40
154822:19	like a carbon fuel of some sort,	no	7
154991:37	and i think 0 that keeps a lot, some people from *-1 exercising.	no	13
155193:47	or or are you, or are they some home distributing the funds back to you.	no	15
155202:46	and then i, and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that *t*-1 do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well.	no	34
155226:17	they have done it some, uh,	no	6
155235:11	uh, some of the,	yes	4
155242:12	i have some friends of mine who *t*-1 use quicken	no	10
155281:73	but, uh, we're to the point *ich*-1 now where our financial income is enough that we can consider *-2 putting some away for college *t*-3,	no	26
155300:12	* find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way 0 we will be able *-1 to, uh, do it *t*-2.	no	22
155307:76	well our situation is just a little bit, kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, uh, took on a full time job,	no	38
155336:38	uh, a colleague of mine at, uh, work got some information over, uh, the computer network called * internet.	no	19
155363:18	we could talk about some of the long range goals	yes	10
155368:62	uh, well i think, 0 either my wife or i would like *-1 to pursue advanced degrees at some point	no	20
155415:45	we're trying *-1 to think of how * to put away some savings and stuff like that *t*-2	no	19
155421:27	we'd like *-1 to do that some day.	no	9
155612:26	so so there is some good to it.	no	8
155641:88	if my parents were *-1 to get ill, i would like *-2 to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help.	no	28
155671:20	and then there's also some that *t*-1 are set *-2 up for specialties	no	14
155675:16	uh, i know some.	no	4
155676:10	unfortunately, some elderly have * to go to or have, i guess 0 it's *rnr*-2 alzheimer's or where they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem *t*-1.	no	32
155676:120	unfortunately, some elderly have * to go to or have, i guess 0 it's *rnr*-2 alzheimer's or where they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem *t*-1.	no	32
155726:30	and i i've seen some of them like that too	yes	11
155768:23	uh, guy, uh, some of my things, i, i'd like *-1 to have a short work week you know,	yes	20
155945:65	i think 0 by *-1 putting term limitations on you could, you could slow down some of the problems.	yes	19
155950:11	i know some senators,	no	4
156065:131	but i, i think that there are, there are advantages to * having seniority and, uh, turn-, or, not having a complete turnover every, some small number of years.	no	29
156153:21	and i think also 0 some of the, uh, car companies are coming out with, uh, gas powered fleets so you,	yes	21
156223:103	well, you also have the very close related thing of the, uh, rain forest destruction which *t*-1 is the main source of what *t*-2's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants.	yes	35
156247:36	well, not, not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the, uh, major pollution sources as you do out in denver *ich*-2 with the inversion and los angeles and a-, rest of california which *t*-1 is just terrible it sounds.	no	45
156419:18	i had, uh, some visitor	no	5
156618:53	i mean, it *exp*-1 seems absurd that people will pay, you know, some bucks just *-2 to get someone to,	no	20
156793:8	but some of them have already been in youth centers. and that kind of thing,	yes	15
156804:8	and some of them are our problems,	yes	7
156825:41	but if you could find a way 0 * to prevent some of it *t*-4, and i'm not sure what it would be *t*-1. it would be money better *ich*-2 spent * than,	yes	34
156851:33	i'm for it in in some cases.	no	8
157050:25	i think 0 i've seen some statistics that *t*-1 say that, uh, it *exp*-2's more expensive *ich*-3 * to kill somebody than * to keep them in prison for life.	no	32
157092:10	but in some cases, yes.	no	5
157203:39	well, i, i think 0 on some of it, you have *-1 to say 0 someone's responsible for his actions.	yes	21
157650:23	i've been out here twenty some years	no	8
157668:160	well, the, the one thing that i know 0 *t*-1 does seem *-2 to happen from people 0 i've talked to *t*-3 on this, is that in the situation 0 you just said *t*-4 where it's nine to three, or some such number *t*-5, that there's, an effect 0 *t*-7 starts *-8 being that there's starts *-6 being a lot of peer pressure going on	no	69
157673:10	and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire *ich*-1 of people *-2 to get out of there and not be stuck *-2 in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons.	no	43
157676:109	i'd read one book, i think 0 it was calls *-1 trial by jury of all things, that, uh *t*-2 went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases *-3 looking at what *t*-4 had, at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, uh, based on the deliberations.	yes	66
158089:67	well, i do think 0 with working parents it is, i mean, there are some real issues here. um, that i think, um,	no	23
158116:34	and it has, um, helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise *?* *t*-2 that i think 0 *t*-1 are wonderful particularly at this age,	no	32
158232:209	and i think that the people who *t*-1 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level. uh, you know, whether it be a biblical force, uh, you know, the eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a knife, life type logic or just, uh, uh, some sort of anger at * putting peop-, putting, uh, murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life, uh, while we foot the bill.	no	84
158276:20	like * say 0 some young kids or something like that that *t*-1 might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had *-2 to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot *-3 by a firing squad or something like that.	no	50
158338:52	but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without *-1 having some sort of, of discrimination or, or, you know, uh, appeal on * not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff.	no	43
158343:99	it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not, he's not getting a jury of his peers which *t*-1 is in some ways i think 0 *t*-2 true.	no	34
158370:62	but i, i rather imagine 0 there's, there's some snickering about it. and a lot of the usually fatalistic, uh, here we go again folks, kind of stuff.	no	30
158417:27	she, she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the, with the owner of the store.	no	20
158417:44	she, she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the, with the owner of the store.	no	20
158525:22	this child was crying and needed some comfort, you know,	no	10
158631:39	but they also did, they also did some of the teaching things	yes	12
158665:46	i think, i think 0 there's definitely been some changes, um,	no	12
158704:32	and it must have reflected, uh, uh, some awful good, uh, diplomacy on the part of the u s.	no	19
158902:45	well i did work, um, just very mumblex for some time	no	11
159122:18	then i know of some of the people that *t*-1 have gotten their masters	yes	14
159194:33	but there's, there's some weird law where, uh, uh, student employees working for the government don't have *-1 to pay social security tax *t*-2.	no	27
159266:27	and i think 0 maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars.	yes	20
159274:140	each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what, um, the going, you know, if you will *?* the going, uh, award should be *t*-1 for a certain type of case, you know, within some kind of range.	no	41
159280:82	who it really penalizes *t*-1 is their insurance company which *t*-2 then translates into higher rates for all of us. if they get some of those mega awards against them.	yes	30
159294:21	and, uh, granted 0 some people need *-1 to be compensated *-2 if they have really been wronged *-3, you know.	no	21
159296:86	well, how do you feel *t*-2 about * setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb *t*-1.	no	28
159302:14	you know some of the health insurance is written *-1 that way. you know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it s-, pre specified in the policy so much	yes	37
159312:47	i, i think 0 it has *-1 to be some kind of common sense applied * there.	no	17
159389:10	but in some instances you're going *-1 to put companies out of business by *-2 taking that stance, if they have *-3 to take it out of their own retained earnings.	no	32
159437:33	and, uh, then i had *-1 to do some volunteer work here in tyler, texas	no	15
159514:8	and some of the really nice ones that *t*-1 really take care of their people are so expensive. because cause they can afford *-2 to hire the people that *t*-3 are really going * to care for the older.	yes	39
159743:40	i, i even like guns and roses, some of their stuff.	yes	11
159747:15	but, uh, some of these groups now like slaughter.	yes	9
159970:32	i guess that *'s not large compared to some,	no	10
160240:29	uh, you know, as sort of some development and some training, uh,	no	12
160240:36	uh, you know, as sort of some development and some training, uh,	no	12
160313:29	but, i think 0 there should be some kind of curbside service.	no	12
160637:88	and for the longer term i, i read, uh, like scientific american and, and, uh, readers' digest and some of those other types of magazines that *t*-1 come out which, they,	yes	32
160756:8	and some of it, i mean, is,	yes	7
160911:102	well, i, i mean, i think 0 there's some people, there, y-, certainly are some things where you need infrastructure *t*-1	no	22
161150:10	but also some poodles, uh	no	5
161155:11	there are some smart ones out there,	no	7
161156:26	but there's some also some, uh, not so smart ones.	no	11
161163:79	that's, that's, maybe that's, there's, uh, some credence in that statement.	no	15
161180:15	i mean, some people seem fairly well suited for for, uh, miniature poodles and such.	no	15
161209:14	well, because some people, uh, want *-1 to train them as,	no	11
161272:36	they're banned *-1 from, in some areas i understand 0 *t*-2.	no	12
161349:39	well, you should, you should have some opinions on that, then.	no	11
161351:15	i do have some thoughts on that,	no	7
161449:22	i'm into, uh, some industrial music that *t*-1's, a, a bit even harder than that.	no	17
161543:23	but i also dislike, uh, some classical music,	no	8
161659:14	so you got some lakes around 0 you can do that on *t*-1.	no	13
161792:24	i'd like *-1 to do some sailing.	no	8
161826:7	but some people are more motorboaters, you know which *t*-1 is fine.	no	12
161841:21	you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people *ich*-1 behind *t*-2, the skiers,	no	14
162098:63	but i keep, i keep *-1 thinking that there's got *-2 to be some way, that, that a lot of this is circumstances *t*-3.	no	25
162141:71	* stop *-1 trying *-3 to attack supply because, which, which to some extent *t*-2 makes sense and to some extent *t*-2 doesn't.	no	24
162141:91	* stop *-1 trying *-3 to attack supply because, which, which to some extent *t*-2 makes sense and to some extent *t*-2 doesn't.	no	24
162164:33	and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans as well.	no	16
162325:44	it, it *exp*-1's hard * to beat some of the,	yes	11
162412:56	but, uh, there's a four o one k plan uh, for, uh, * sheltering some taxable income.	no	18
162478:59	i, i guess 0 they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that	no	26
162807:36	something 0 i picked *t*-1 up in a psychology class some time ago.	no	13
162812:65	it's that * the younger 0 they are *t*-2, they tend *-1 to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,	no	22
162828:72	well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such *t*-1. i think 0 there ought *-2 to be a unanimous, uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this.	no	56
163289:33	i think 0 at each wal-mart, they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that, which *t*-1 now,	no	18
163356:17	uh, i bought some cokes *ich*-1 the other day in the br-, the little bottles you know,	no	17
163402:36	but i, i do know 0 some of these places were doing that	yes	13
163458:200	and i, i guess 0 i'll do this for, i was doing this for, actually, i was going *-1 to do it for my son so that he could, uh, he, he's in high school, so that he could make some money.	no	44
163531:87	but i think 0 it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have *-1 to exercise some quick judgment in the field.	no	33
163578:60	i guess i k-, i think 0 it's got some relevance,	no	12
163598:67	they're, they should be able *-1 to make it as a continue of employment in some sense	no	18
163649:39	and, and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn 0 * to retire *t*-1 *t*-2, the money will be there for us.	no	32
163673:61	i'm not sure if we know what * to do *t*-2 in terms of * curing some who *t*-1 has already gotten polio.	no	24
163682:37	that, that histor-, for some reason, historical sites with, you know, the, the full federal money and everything seem *-1 to appear as, as almost as like political favors to, to very strong politicians.	no	34
163691:87	so, it sounds like you, uh, you think that, that we'd be able *-1 to save some money by, uh *-2 passing the line item veto.	no	27
163717:52	the-, the-, there has *-1 to be some way 0 * to do it *t*-2.	no	15
163775:38	i'm more, uh, old rock and roll, uh, some new, newer, i guess 0 you would call it *ich*-1 heavy metal rock and roll type you know, uh, van halen, that kind of thing.	no	35
163790:21	so, some some of the older eagles stuff was good.	no	10
163805:15	but, uh, some of their older s-, stuff was, uh, you know, quite enjoyable to me.	yes	16
163819:68	uh, so, anything new 0 you like *t*-1 *ich*-3 *ich*-4 coming out now, other than folk music, some 0 i might know of *t*-2.	no	24
163851:17	i think 0 some of them, the artists are even, uh, hitting the pop charts.	yes	15
163972:57	see, that's one thing 0 i like *t*-1 about the, uh, some of the folk music scenes, you know,	no	20
164027:11	there are some, but not, not very high.	no	8
164181:49	i know 0 they s-, they're coming out with some v eight now	no	14
164186:18	so, they've got some pretty powerful sixes.	no	8
164198:48	but there's so many occasions when i've had *-1 to move some members of the family or do this or that *t*-2,	no	24
164221:38	and we weren't aware of it, and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car,	no	19
164223:15	so, we got some monster studded snow tires after that.	no	10
164239:23	and it's, uh, got some nice features in terms of * being able *-1 to remove seats and flip them around	no	22
164243:29	so we've been able *-1 to do some real creative, uh, load hauling when * called upon *-2 *t*-3.	no	20
164258:56	i think that we're going *-1 to be, uh, owning a mini van for some years 0 *t*-2 to come.	no	21
164333:23	i, in some ways, it's almost worse than murder.	no	10
164407:36	but, i think 0 you have *-1 to accept some of the errors.	yes	13
164495:23	well, i think that in some cases, it is warranted.	no	10
164502:18	i think 0 in some cases it *exp*-1 doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not.	no	18
164519:13	well, for some things.	no	4
164556:49	but, then, you know, i think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. you know, just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who *t*-1 abused them *t*-2	no	40
164793:53	although i, you know, i'm sorry *-1 to see some of their, uh,	yes	14
164929:134	one of the things that i found *t*-1 interesting last year during the, uh, the gulf conflict was a sentiment against, uh, peter arnett, who *t*-2 had stayed in iraq and was presenting, uh, some of the things that *t*-3 were available.	yes	42
165017:60	there wasn't as many advanced placement courses *ich*-3, uh, when i was a senior *t*-1 that some other schools had *t*-2.	no	22
165108:23	* ended up *-1 getting some scholarships 0 * to go to college *t*-2 and which *t*-3 has been, you know, which *t*-4 is really nice,	no	26
165389:35	the other thing 0 i let them do *t*-1 some times is that i let them go through and let them tell me what, let them do the diagnostics.	no	29
165437:28	well it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that	no	12
165669:42	and then with that i try and handle, you know, some of the clothes that the girls need *t*-1 and things like that,	yes	23
165759:38	and then you have *-1 to really sit down and plan some more	no	13
165808:15	i've heard some about saturns.	no	6
165842:31	and i found that while you can find some cars that *t*-1 are comfortable 0 * to ride in *t*-2, uh, * finding a ca-, car *ich*-5 anymore that *t*-3's, that *t*-4's fairly easy 0 for me to work on *t*-6, it's just not very eas-, it's not very,	no	53
165905:15	i've driven some, uh, tauruses *ich*-2 over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips *t*-1. uh, as rental cars.	no	25
166012:17	some, some local communities are very active in that, uh, in that respect	no	13
166058:129	i think 0 here if they, uh, instead of * just, you know, requiring that you put, put out the trash and stuff, if they *ich*-2 could get some kind of rebate, those people who *t*-1 do put the stuff out, uh, you know, and separate it, have lower collection fee or something * may encourage people to separate.	no	59
166099:34	now i think 0 they've come up with some way of, uh, * pulling the glue out.	no	18
166239:186	and then, sometimes i, i often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. yo-, a microwave, a v c r, a answering machine a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,	yes	50
166324:27	i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know *t*-1 personally get paid *-2 an awful lot more than,	yes	24
166332:14	but there are some school districts out there that *t*-1 are very well paid.	no	14
166609:11	that's some brutal stuff there.	no	6
166790:41	oh, here's *t*-2 an easy way 0 * to make some money *t*-1.	no	14
166792:44	i, i've heard, fairly recently, uh, some talk about that in this, in, in my state.	no	17
166920:103	because, uh, i th-, you know, i think 0 for a lot of people it really is the decision of, do they still have some of their life left.	yes	29
166932:14	but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able *-1 to deal with *t*-2 physically anymore.	yes	21
166950:129	often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or alzheimer's disease or those or, or physical and mental handicaps. uh, you know, where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind. even though it may be minimal *t*-1.	no	41
166957:30	at least, i mean i think 0 some nursing homes do that.	no	12
166964:64	i think that a majority of the places in the u s, uh, you know, there is some government aid available,	no	21
166974:17	* definitely does need some improvements.	no	6
167035:53	i think 0 that should be left *-2 up to people who *t*-1 have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have *?*.	no	29
167062:56	matter of fact, i've heard that, i've heard that some of the information *ich*-2, uh, is prevented *-1 from *-1 reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that,	yes	41
167130:52	um, s-, s-, naturally some, some things you just can't find *t*-1 in your local k-mart or, or, uh, bryn mawr stereo dealer.	no	24
167175:44	and there r-, there are s-, some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try *-1 to avoid that.	no	20
167197:74	uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for *-3 policing themselves, then i think 0 some well defined mechanisms need *-1 to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity f-, * to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided *-2.	no	51
167230:60	* to prevent these people from *-1 ever getting out on the street. by, you know, some technicality.	no	18
167234:13	and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again *-1 doing the same 0 they did *t*-2 before.	no	23
167460:11	they had some property there	no	5
167520:43	and, uh they have put plastic, plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows.	yes	15
167853:33	uh, although i i'm sure 0 to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity,	no	20
167861:60	and, uh you know, and so the students were, you know, to some extent, motivated *-1 to learn.	no	18
167923:114	so, i guess 0 the problem is 0 the, the thing 0 * to do *t*-1 is * to try *-2 to, uh, to get some kind of motivation * to learn	no	32
168092:41	they'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense.	no	14
168240:39	if you have yard trash, you put your yard trash in some kind of container.	no	15
168375:16	but they get into some really good conversations sometimes, you know.	no	11
168376:8	and some of it, sometimes it's serious	yes	8
168377:14	and they have some good feedback and all that stuff	no	10
168394:161	uh, and really, i-, i-, we were really forced *-2 into *-3 keeping a budget because i'm, i'm paid once a month which *t*-1 sort of, sort of forces some, uh, uh, restrictions	no	35
168678:18	like i said, some years ago, i think 0 i would have said 0 there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country.	no	26
168694:29	i'm beginning *-1 to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, uh, that, uh, uh, costs and other factors justify, uh, uh, * executing people.	no	28
168702:40	and, uh i can imagine that, uh, uh, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case.	no	22
168731:49	not so much because, uh, it's bad per se, although there is some pretty crappy programming	no	17
168732:33	and i thin-, there's also some, uh, i think, uh, poorer lifestyles illustrated * but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time.	no	24
168933:15	but there were some things *ich*-3 that people brought *t*-1 up like well what *t*-2 happens if they, they get a false positive, you know, what recourse do you have *t*-4.	no	31
168948:53	and if they're, you know, if they're on some kind of, you know, contol-, controlled substance then, you know, it kinds of takes away from the job of, you know, the supervisor or manager type person, you know, who *t*-1 is able *-2 to evaluate them.	no	48
169040:30	either you have, uh, military service or some sort of alternative, nonmilitary service for a few years.	no	17
169077:64	for, for years there has been an idea *ich*-2 batted * around of * having some sort of alternative, uh, public service 0 for, uh, young people to go into *t*-3, uh, after high school.	no	35
169087:61	and they, they at least have, now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline.	no	18
169088:56	and they have, uh, you know, in, in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say, they can see that, you know, if i do something or sub-, submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever, at least for a short period of time, i can accomplish a lot	no	56
169093:37	and, you know, for some, for some young men, that's good.	no	12
169102:41	so. but, uh, you know, for some people that's good.	no	11
169134:30	uh, i know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders.	no	16
169138:54	uh, that *ich*-1's kind of gone up in scale and, and some other things.	no	15
169475:51	and i can, i can, you know, accept that some people think 0 it's not *?* and can find better ways 0 * to use it *t*-1.	no	29
169520:110	we ended up *-2 watching it for a couple of hours. zooming out and grabbing something 0 * to eat *t*-1 and then zooming back and ea-, watching it some more.	no	31
169775:14	and they had some guy that *t*-1 was, uh, defending himself.	no	11
169826:13	and it was some malaria medication	no	6
169900:67	so you know, i guess 0 you sort of, you have *-1 to have trust some place along the way.	no	20
169930:79	i mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of *t*-1 later on	no	28
169968:20	uh, but, uh, some friends of mine have, uh, gone through this.	no	12
169969:80	i think 0 i'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention *t*-1 and, uh, where they did some things *-2 to try *-3 to keep them, um, mentally alive *t*-4. and where there was, uh, caring and compassionate, where there were caring and compassionate people, uh, operating it *t*-5.	no	54
170002:63	we used *-1 to go once a month, once every two months *-2 to visit some of the patients there.	yes	20
170010:51	do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with *t*-1, that the people who *t*-2 operate it seem *-3 to have, what you'd perceive of *t*-4 as genuine concern?	no	39
170014:94	i, i think sometimes, you know, i've noticed, uh, people asking for, uh, some of the patients asking for things *ich*-1, uh, just repetitively and, but things that *t*-2 are not reasonable,	yes	33
170018:13	and so at some level the, the, the, uh,	no	9
170051:85	and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, yo-, you, you walk into some rooms *t*-1 and there's, it's completely generic.	no	25
170133:26	a couple of times we've tried some things	no	9
170298:14	we actually do some work with some people down at georgia tech.	no	12
170298:23	we actually do some work with some people down at georgia tech.	no	12
170355:33	so there should be something *ich*-2 in there or some kind of clause that *t*-1 will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.	no	34
170605:50	and i don't think 0 our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some.	no	17
170848:36	because i know 0 my grandparents wanted *-1 to have some independence still.	no	13
170852:13	they wanted some place 0 they can go and have their meals *t*-1 and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her	no	24
170860:12	there was some sort of full-time care place that *t*-1 was also associated *-2 with it	no	16
170966:55	uh, i've had, uh, three boys *ich*-1 through, i guess, uh, some child care, each one of them	no	19
170980:30	you'd like *-1 to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care.	no	18
170998:111	aren't don't they kind of use them for, everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? for their per-, for their pet theories or some such thing?	no	29
171044:26	and they finding, in some cases they're finding 0 it *exp*-1's just not worth it * to work because it's all going out in daycare.	no	28
171232:7	some of that is really bad i think 0 *t*-1.	yes	10
171309:31	well i think 0 the court systems could stand some improvement.	no	11
171392:65	but i guess, i guess 0 i like the system that they have *t*-1 in some places where the defendant gets *-3 to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets *t*-2 to choose it *t*-4.	no	43
171393:18	some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that.	no	10
171393:29	some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that.	no	10
171406:112	but, the thing is too, 0 maybe they need more of a, i don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an-, and call them in.	yes	53
171448:70	but i think 0 about, uh, about a year ago, uh, i bought a product from some company down at, uh, in atlanta, georgia.	no	24
171454:40	but i found that, uh, it was made *-1 of some material which *t*-2 actually ended up *-3 rusting uh, after,	no	21
171568:49	and they will gladly, no questions asked *-1, take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide 0 you don't want it anymore.	no	25
171787:14	they've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.	no	12
171801:25	and, uh, they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth.	no	14
171802:32	and it recently was sold *-1 to, uh, some other people	no	11
171877:28	and that's suppose *-1 to be some of the, uh, the male bonding and the, and the, uh, the male instincts, i guess 0 *t*-2, or something about the, uh,	yes	31
172028:13	we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more.	no	32
172028:20	we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more.	no	32
172028:93	we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more.	no	32
172041:88	that you miss *t*-1 *-2 sitting home in your parlor, you know, uh, with, with a six pack of beer and some, uh, potato chips, you know	no	27
172078:56	i, i kind of agree with that, because i think 0 in some cases, uh, the jury may not even have, the information about other crimes 0 the person has committed *t*-1.	no	32
172086:38	uh, i, i think that in some cases that's considered *-1 to prejudice the current case	no	17
172116:15	there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed *-1 a jury trial *t*-2?	no	18
172153:17	but i meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going *-1 to have a judge here *t*-2.	no	21
172313:40	i've found that most of homework assignments mumblex really require some sort of computer, uh, simulation or analysis,	no	19
172344:12	i have some games *ich*-2, of course, which i play *t*-1 on there	no	13
172383:115	i mean, obviously, i do most of my, almost all of my report writing on, on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments.	no	30
172560:22	* still's that way to some extent.	no	8
172708:132	when you have the, when you have the, uh, the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has *t*-1 *t*-2, and you can, uh, offer some incentive	no	29
172751:34	there ought *-4 to be, uh, uh, some compromise that *t*-1 could, where, uh, where the person would be guaranteed *-2 a, uh, career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh, in exchange for a longer period of time *t*-3.	no	46
172778:10	at least some companies.	no	4
172791:51	there's no other way. i mean uh, unless they're part of some extended family which *t*-1 is unlikely.	no	20
173236:19	if i only had some place that i could store the, uh, camper top *t*-1, i would have it off most of the time.	no	24
173415:8	but some of them are very rich	yes	7
173845:19	and by definition, for some of us, at least, the public good includes * having an educated populace and then idea that, uh, you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the, at the local level or bigger votes at the national level.	yes	47
173933:38	well, when mine were growing up *t*-1, i did some traveling and but not that extensively	no	16
174279:15	i've got some friends that *t*-1 are lawyers	no	9
174317:40	when i was, a couple of years ago, involved in some pretrial stuff *t*-1 and	no	15
174424:30	and, in fact, they're even letting some go.	no	9
174502:49	if some, if it *exp*-1 were possible * to market some, uh, form of, uh, space technology, you know, * to, uh, uh, to make it equitable, it might severely help the economy, you know, in the, in the, uh, respect that, you know, there's endless amounts of research 0 *t*-2 to be done *-3. endless amounts of resources and and whatnot,	no	63
174506:31	it would be great if we could find some way 0 * to, to, uh, use that * to boost the economy *t*-1.	no	23
174512:105	i've always, uh, felt that, uh, uh, one of the long-term solutions that, at least a few of our problems would be * to have, uh, some sort of, uh, solar power satellites up.	no	35
174529:151	so the side effects of * doing that which i think 0 *t*-1 would be good, you know, very, very good for al-, for everyone in the long run is, uh, is it, 0 some of the other things 0 i'd like *-2 to see *t*-3 happen would happen also,	no	51
174561:139	the only commitments that they're interested in *-1 making *t*-2 or even talking about *t*-2 are ones for flash value like, uh, the trip to mars. which *t*-3 is, would, would produce some useful scientific research and so forth,	no	40
174665:8	in some ways i don't like it because it's like they're playing god.	no	16
174676:23	and, of course, you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money *-1 keeping people in jail or not.	no	19
174889:107	and i guess 0 the only drawback *ich*-2 0 i can see *t*-1 to, to drug testing is in, 0 in case you are on some sort of medication that *t*-3 might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.	no	48
174889:133	and i guess 0 the only drawback *ich*-2 0 i can see *t*-1 to, to drug testing is in, 0 in case you are on some sort of medication that *t*-3 might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.	no	48
174889:168	and i guess 0 the only drawback *ich*-2 0 i can see *t*-1 to, to drug testing is in, 0 in case you are on some sort of medication that *t*-3 might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.	no	48
174908:32	like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind, you know, what are they going *-1 to do *t*-2 about that.	no	23
174958:20	so, uh, there's some noise on this end.	no	9
175026:43	and while i don't do any drugs myself, i've seen some people who *t*-1 work there, uh, you know, smoking a joint or whatever.	no	26
175492:8	even some of the immediate things that i need *-1 to know *t*-2, i don't know it until the next hour	yes	22
175706:20	uh, if it was some you know, * coming into the store and stuff, then she would ha-, whoever *t*-1 made the purchase would have had *-2 find some kind of, uh, you know, document	no	35
175706:114	uh, if it was some you know, * coming into the store and stuff, then she would ha-, whoever *t*-1 made the purchase would have had *-2 find some kind of, uh, you know, document	no	35
175762:11	and for some of them it was just kind of, i don't know, not so much a holiday,	yes	19
175787:53	uh, i guess 0 you'd have *-1 to call them great men in some sense.	no	16
175796:24	and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the vietnam war. that the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had *-1 to draw a line and, and defend it.	yes	41
175818:89	well, i, i, i think 0 we did, i think 0 we did learn some lessons that we weren't, uh, we weren't prepared for *t*-1,	no	27
176264:42	so, uh, but i think 0 there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children	no	17
176316:22	i mean they really had some great opportunities.	no	8
176366:29	th-, there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences.	no	9
176599:17	and i've got some very definite, uh, opinions about it *ich*-1. uh, you know, which *t*-2 haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from, from when they, when they announced it *t*-3. but, uh, developed a little more, i guess, but haven't changed that much.	no	50
176487:27	i'm sure 0 there must be some good ones around here somewhere.	no	13
176621:17	he crashed and killed some people because he was, uh, smoking some marijuana	no	13
176621:42	he crashed and killed some people because he was, uh, smoking some marijuana	no	13
176639:71	uh, and so it's, it's required for certain, some form, some form of drug program is required * to get the government contracts	no	25
176649:101	first off we don't, we don't have enough courage * to, uh, pick out the people that, that *t*-2 have some sort of indication of possible drug usage, uh, because that would offend them, uh, if they, if they weren't *?*.	no	45
176903:54	i i built it *-1 two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff.	no	24

177229:44	they always want *-1 to be able *-2 to, uh, do some brain draining.	no	14
177237:94	at the bottom end, they, uh, are always willing *-1 to, uh, let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of * doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the, powerful people in that area.	no	40
177292:14	but there's some differences in the immigrants, that, that we're getting *t*-1 now.	no	15
177383:87	and the thing that *t*-1 just was in the local news bulletin was, somebody has, uh, ter-, made some special, uh, polymers that *t*-2 have the ability * to, uh, make certain actinide elements adhere to them.	no	37
177386:59	uh, uh, they've, uh, looked at, uh, plutonium and uranium and, uh, some other similar things *-2 to try *-1 to remove those from radio active waste	no	28
